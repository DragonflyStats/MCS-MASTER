	\section{What is a method comparison study?}
	
	% Include Somewhere: An assay is a procedure where a property is measured.
	
	The problem of assessing the agreement between two or more methods
	of measurement is ubiquitous in scientific research, and is
	commonly referred to as a `method comparison study'. \citet{ludbrook97} states that the purpose of comparing two measurements "of a continuous biological variable" is to uncover systematic differences, not to point to similarities". The need to compare the results of two different measurement techniques is common in medical statistics. Published
	examples of method comparison studies can be found in disciplines
	as diverse as pharmacology \citep{ludbrook97}, anaesthesia
	\citep{Myles}, and cardiac imaging methods \citep{Krumm}.
	\smallskip
	
	To illustrate the characteristics of a typical method comparison
	study consider the data in Table I \citep{Grubbs73}. In each of
	twelve experimental trials, a single round of ammunition was fired
	from a 155mm gun and its velocity was measured simultaneously (and
	independently) by three chronographs devices, identified here by
	the labels `Fotobalk', `Counter' and `Terma'.
	\smallskip

	An important aspect of the these data is that all three methods of
	measurement are assumed to have an attended measurement error, and
	the velocities reported in Table 1.1 can not be assumed to be
	`true values' in any absolute sense.
	
	%While lack of
	%agreement between two methods is inevitable, the question , as
	%posed by \citet{BA83}, is 'do the two methods of measurement agree
	%sufficiently closely?'
	
	A method of measurement should ideally be both accurate and
	precise. \citet{Barnhart} describes agreement as being a broader
	term that contains both of those qualities. An accurate
	measurement method will give results close to the unknown `true
	value'. The precision of a method is indicated by how tightly
	measurements obtained under identical conditions are distributed
	around their mean measurement value. A precise and accurate method
	will yield results consistently close to the true value. Of course
	a method may be accurate, but not precise, if the average of its
	measurements is close to the true value, but those measurements
	are highly dispersed. Conversely a method that is not accurate may
	be quite precise, as it consistently indicates the same level of
	inaccuracy. The tendency of a method of measurement to
	consistently give results above or below the true value is a
	source of systematic bias. The smaller the systematic bias, the
	greater the accuracy of the method.
	
	% The FDA define precision as the closeness of agreement (degree of
	% scatter) between a series of measurements obtained from multiple
	% sampling of the same homogeneous sample under prescribed
	% conditions. \citet{Barnhart} describes precision as being further
	% subdivided as either within-run, intra-batch precision or
	% repeatability (which assesses precision during a single analytical
	% run), or between-run, inter-batch precision or repeatability
	%(which measures precision over time).
	
	In the context of the agreement of two methods, there is also a
	tendency of one measurement method to consistently give results
	above or below the other method. Lack of agreement is a
	consequence of the existence of `inter-method bias'. For two
	methods to be considered in good agreement, the inter-method bias
	should be in the region of zero. A simple estimation of the
	inter-method bias can be calculated using the differences of the
	paired measurements. The data in Table 1.2 are a good example of
	possible inter-method bias; the `Fotobalk' consistently recording
	smaller velocities than the `Counter' method. Consequently one
	would conclude that there is lack of agreement between the two
	methods.
	
	The absence of inter-method bias by itself is not sufficient to
	establish whether two measurement methods agree. The two methods
	must also have equivalent levels of precision. Should one method
	yield results considerably more variable than those of the other,
	they can not be considered to be in agreement. With this in mind a
	methodology is required that allows an analyst to estimate the
	inter-method bias, and to compare the precision of both methods of
	measurement.

	\section{Agreement}
	\citet{BA86} defined perfect agreement as the case where all of the pairs of rater data lie along the line of equality, where the line of equality is defined as the 45 degree line passing through the origin , or or X=Y on a XY plane. 
	
	To carry their idea a step further, we define a specific numerical measure of agreement as twice the expected squared perpendicular distance of the pair of random variables ($X_1$, $X_2$) to the line of equality or agreement in the $(X_1,X_2)$-plane, that is, $E(X_1 - X_2)2$, where X1 and X2 denote the continuous measurements of rater 1 and rater 2, respectively.\\
	
	Obviously, other $L_p$ norms may be considered for the purpose of numerically measuring agreement and warrant future consideration. Note that we will use the term rater and measuring device interchangeably throughout this article.
	

	
	Agreement is the extent to which the measure of the variable of interest, under a constant set of experimental conditions, yields the same result on repeated trials (Sanchez et al). The more consistent the results, the more reliable the measuring procedure.
	
	In particular, in medicine, new methods or devices that are cheaper, easier to use, or less invasive, are routinely developed. Agreement between a new method and either a traditional reference or gold standard must be evaluated before the new one is put into practice. Various methodologies have been proposed for this purpose in recent years.

	\section{Equivalence and Interchangeability}
	Limits of agreement are intended to analyse equivalence. How this
	is assessed is the considered judgement of the practitioner. In
	\citet{BA86} an example of good agreement is cited. For two
	methods of measuring `oxygen saturation', the limits of agreement
	are calculated as (-2.0,2.8).A practitioner would ostensibly find
	this to be sufficiently narrow.
	
	If the limits of agreement are not clinically important, which is
	to say that the differences tend not to be substantial, the two
	methods may be used interchangeably. \citet{DunnSEME} takes issue
	with the notion of `equivalence', remarking that while agreement
	indicated equivalence, equivalence does not reflect agreement.
	
	\section{Gold Standard} This is considered to be the most
	accurate measurement of a particular parameter.
	
	\section{Agreement} Bland and Altman (1986) define Perfect
	agreement as 'The case where all of the pairs of rater data lie
	along the line of equality'. The Line of Equality is defined as
	the 45 degree line passing through the origin, or X=Y on a XY
	plane.
	
	\section{Lack Of Agreement}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Constant Bias\item Proportional Bias
	\end{enumerate}
	% % REWRITE
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[Constant Bias] This is a form of systematic deviations estimated as the average difference between the test
		and the reference method.
		\item[Proportional Bias] Two methods may agree on average, but they may exhibit differences over a range of measurements.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Proportional Bias is a difference in the two measures which is proportional to the scale of the measurement. \\Using a naive estimation of bias, such as the mean of differences, it may incorrectly indicate absence of bias, by yielding a mean difference close to zero. This would be caused by positive differences in the measurements at one end of the range of measurements being canceled out by negative differences at the other end of the scale.
	
	\section*{Proportional Bias} Two methods may agree on
	average, but they may exhibit differences over a range of measurements.
	
	
	
	\section{Purpose of Method Comparison Studies}
	\citet{BXC2010} provides a review of many descriptions of the purpose of Method Comparison studies, several of which are reproduced here.
	
	\begin{quote}
		``The question being answered is not always clear, but is usually epxressed as an attempt to quantify the agreement
		between two methods" \citep{BA95}.
		
		``Some lack of agreement between different methods of measurement is inevitable. What matters is the amount by which they disagree. We want to know by how much the new method is likely to differ from the old, so that it is not enough to cause problems in the mathematical interpretation we can preplace the old method by the new, or even use the two interchangeably" \citep{BA99}.
		
		
		``It often happens that the same physical and chemical property can be measured in different ways. For example, one can determine For example, one can determine sodium in serum by flame atomic emission spectroscopy or by isotope dilution mass spectroscopy. The question arises as to which method is better" (Mandel, 1991).
		
		``In areas of inter-laboratory quality control, method comparisons, assay validations and individual bio-equivalence, etc, the agreement between observations and target (reference) values is
		of interest" \citep{lin2002}.
		
		``The purpose of comparing two methods of measurement of a continuous biological variable is to uncover systematic differences, not to point to
		similarities`" \citep{ludbrook97}.
		
		``In the pharmaceutical industry, measurement methods that measure the quantity of prdocuts are regulated. The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) requires that the manufacturer show equivalency prior to approving the new or alternatice method in quality control" (Tan \& Inglewicz, 1999). 
	\end{quote}
	
	While several major commonalities are present in each definitions, there is a different emphasis for each, which will inevitably give rise to confusion. \citet{BXC2010} seems to endorse a simple phrasing of the research question that is proposed by \citet{BA83}, i.e. ``\textit{do the two methods of measurement agree sufficiently closely?}" with \citet{BXC2010} expressing the view that other considerations (for example, the ``equivalence" of two methods) to be treated as separate research questions. As such, we will revert to other research questions, such as ``equivalence of methods" later, focussing on agreement and repeatability of methods.

	


	
	
	

	\section{Discussion on Method Comparison Studies}
	
	The need to compare the results of two different measurement
	techniques is common in medical statistics.
	\\
	\\
	In particular, in medicine, new methods or devices that are
	cheaper, easier to use, or less invasive, are routinely developed.
	Agreement between a new method and a traditional reference or gold
	standard must be evaluated before the new one is put into
	practice. Various methodologies have been proposed for this
	purpose in recent years.
	

	Historically comparison of two methods of measurement was carried
	out by use of paired sample $t-$test, correlation coefficients or
	simple linear regression. Simple linear regression is unsuitable for method comparison studies because of the required assumption that one variable is measured without error. In comparing two methods, both methods are assume to have attendant random error.
	



	The problem of assessing the agreement between two or more methods
	of measurement is ubiquitous in scientific research, and is
	commonly referred to as a `method comparison study'. Published
	examples of method comparison studies can be found in disciplines
	as diverse as Pharmacology \citep{ludbrook97}, Anaesthesia
	\citep{Myles}, and cardiac imaging methods \citep{Krumm}.
	\smallskip
	
	To illustrate the characteristics of a typical method comparison
	study consider the data in Table I, taken from \citet{Grubbs73}.
	In each of twelve experimental trials a single round of ammunition
	was fired from a 155mm gun, and its velocity was measured
	simultaneously (and independently) by three chronographs devices,
	referred to here as `Fotobalk', `Counter' and `Terma'.
	\smallskip
	
	
	
	
	\section{Bias}
	Bland and Altman define bias a \emph{a consistent tendency for one
		method to exceed the other} and propose estimating its value
	by determining the mean of the differences. The variation about
	this mean shall be estimated by the  standard deviation of the
	differences. Bland and Altman remark that these estimates are based on the
	assumption that bias and variability are constant throughout the
	range of measures.
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	
	
	
	
	\subsection*{Constant Bias} This is a form of systematic
	deviations estimated as the average difference between the test
	and the reference method
	
	
	\subsection*{Proportional Bias} Two methods may agree on
	average, but they may exhibit differences over a range of
	measurements.
	
	


	\section{Statement of a Model}
	\citet{BXC2010} presents a useful formulation for comparing two methods $X$ and $Y$, in their measurement of item $i$, where the unknown `true value' is $\tau_i$. Other authors, such as \citet{kinsella}, present similar formulations of the same model, as well as modified models to account for multiple measurements by each methods on each item, known as replicate measurements.
	
	\begin{eqnarray} X_i = \tau_i + \delta_i , \phantom{spacin} \delta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\delta)\\ Y_i = \alpha + \beta \tau_i + \epsilon_i, \phantom{spaci}  \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon)\end{eqnarray}
	
	In some types of analysis, such as the conversion problems described by \citet{lewis}, an estimate for 
	the scaling factor $\beta$ may also be sought. For the time being, we will restrict ourselves to problems where $\beta$ is assumed to be 1. 
	
	\begin{eqnarray}
		X_i = \tau_i + \delta_i , \phantom{spacin} \delta_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\delta)\\
		Y_i = \alpha + \beta \tau_i + \epsilon_i, \phantom{spaci}  \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon)
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	In this formulation, $\alpha$ represents the inter-method bias, and can be estimated as $E(X-Y)$. That is to say, a simple estimate of the inter-method bias is given by the differences between pairs of measurements.  Table~\ref{FCTdata} is a good example of possible inter-method bias; the `Fotobalk' consistently recording
	smaller velocities than the `Counter' method. A cursory inspection of the table will indicate a systematic tendency for the Counter method to result in higher measurements than the Fotobalk method. % Consequently one would conclude that there is lack of agreement % between the two methods.

	Bland and Altman attend to the issue of repeated measures in
	$1996$.
	\\
	Repeated measurements on several subjects can be used to quantify
	measurement error, the variation between measurements of the same
	quantity on the same individual.
	\\
	Bland and Altman discuss two metrics for measurement error; the
	within-subject standard deviation ,and the correlation
	coefficient.
	
	The above plot incorporates both the conventional limits of
	agreement ( the inner pair of dashed lines), the `$t-$' limits of
	agreement ( the outer pair of dashed lines) centred around the
	inter-method bias (indicated by the full line). This plot is
	intended for expository purposes only, as the sample size is
	small.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\section{Inappropriate Methodologies} Use of the Pearson
	Correlation Coefficient , although seemingly intuitive, is not
	appropriate approach to assessing agreement of two methods.
	Arguments against its usage have been made repeatedly in the
	relevant literature. It is possible for two analytical methods to
	be highly correlated, yet have a poor level of agreement.


	
	
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%


			\section{Paired T tests} This method can be applied to test for
			statistically significant deviations in bias. This method can be
			potentially misused for method comparison studies.
			\\It is a poor measure of agreement when the rater's measurements
			are perpendicular to the line of equality[Hutson et al]. In this
			context, an average difference of zero between the two raters, yet
			the scatter plot displays strong negative correlation.
			
			%======================================================================================= %
			
	\section{Inappropriate use of the Correlation Coefficient}
		%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%		\section{Pearson's Correlation Coefficient} 
It is well known that Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear 		association between two variables, not the agreement between two variables (e.g., see Bland and Altman 1986).

This is a well known as a measure of linear association between two	variables. Nonetheless this is not necessarily the same as Agreement. This method is considered wholly inadequate to assess
		agreement because it only evaluates only the association of two sets of observations.
		
		
	It is intuitive when dealing with two sets of related data, i.e
	the results of the two raters, to calculate the correlation
	coefficient (r). Bland and Altman attend to this in their $1999$
	paper.
	
	They present a data set from two sets of meters, and an
	accompanying scatterplot. An hypothesis test on the data set leads
	us to conclude that there is a relationship between both sets of
	meter measurements. The correlation coeffiecient is determined to
	be $r =0.94 $. However, this high correlation does not mean that the
	two methods agree. It is possible to determine from the
	scatterplot that the intercept is not zero, a requirement for
	stating both methods have high agreement. Essentially, should two
	methods have highly correlated results, it does not follow that
	they have high agreement.
	
	
	

	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%

	
	\newpage

	\section*{Intra-class correlation coefficient}
	\begin{itemize}
%		\item The intra-class correlation coefficient has a name guaranteed to cause the eyes to glaze over and shut the mouth of anyone who isn't an analyst. 
		\item The ICC, which takes on values between 0 and 1, is based on analysis of variance techniques. It is close to 1 when the differences between paired measurements is very small compared to the differences between subjects. Of these three procedures--t test, correlation coefficient, intra-class correlation coefficient--the ICC is best because it can be large only if there is no bias and the paired measurements are in good agreement, but it suffers from the same faults ii and iii as ordinary correlation coefficients. The magnitude of the ICC can be manipulated by the choice of samples to split and says nothing about the magnitude of the paired differences.
	\end{itemize}

	\section*{Regression Methods}
 Regression analysis is typically misused by regressing one measurement on the other and declare them equivalent if and only if the confidence interval for the regression coefficient includes 1. Some simple mathematics shows that if the measurements are comparable, the population value of the regression coefficient will be equal to the correlation coefficient between the two methods. 
 
		
	The population correlation coefficient may be close to 1, but is never 1 in practice. Thus, the only things that can be indicated by the presence of 1 in the confidence interval for the regression coefficient is (1) that the measurements are comparable but there weren't enough observations to distinguish between 1 and the population regression coefficient, or (2) the population regression coefficient is 1 and therefore, the measurements aren't comparable.
		
 There is a line whose slope will be 1 if the measurements are comparable. It is known as a structural equation and is the method advanced by Kelly (1985). Altman and Bland (1987) criticize it for a reason that should come as no surprise: Knowing the data are consistent with a structural equation with a slope of 1 says something about the absence of bias but *nothing* about the variability about Y = X (the difference between the measurements), which, as has already been stated, is all that really matters.

	\section{Survival-Agreement Plot}
	A graphical technique for method comparison studies, that is entirely different to the Bland-Altman plot, was proposed by \citet{luiz}. This approach, known as the survival-agreement plot, is used to determine the degree of agreement using the Kaplan-Meier method, a well known graphical technique in the area of Survival Analysis. Furthermore \citet{luiz} propose that commonly used survival analysis techniques should complement this method,\textit{ providing a new analytical insight
		for agreement}. Two survival?agreement plots are used to detect the bias between to measurements of the same variable. The presence of inter-method bias is tested with the log-rank test, and its magnitude with Cox regression.
	
	%% TOLERANCE - REWRITE THIS
	
	The degree of agreement (or disagreement) of a measure is expressed as a function of several limits of tolerance, using the Kaplan-Meier method, where the failures occur exactly at absolute values of the differences between the two methods of measurement. 
	
	According to Luiz et al, the survival-agreement plot is a step function of a typical survival analysis without censored data, where the Y axis represents the proportion of discordant cases. This is equivalent to a step function where the X axis represents the absolute  observed differences and the Y axis is the proportion of the cases with at least the observed 
	difference ($x_i$).

	% MCS Mountain Plot Notebook
	
	\section{Mountain Plot} Krouwer and Monti have proposed a folded empirical cumulative distribution plot, otherwise known as a Mountain plot.
	
	They argue that it is suitable for detecting large, infrequent errors. This is a non-parametric method that can be used as a complement with the Bland Altman plot.  Mountain plots are created by computing a percentile
	for each ranked difference between a new method and a reference method. (Folded plots are so called because of the following transformation is performed for all percentiles above 50: percentile = 100 - percentile.) These percentiles are then plotted against the differences between the two methods.
	
	Krouwer and Monti argue that the mountain plot offers some following advantages. It is easier to find the central $95\%$ of the data, even when the data are not normally distributed. Also, comparison on different distributions can be performed with ease.
	
	
	


	\section{Measurement Error Models}
	\textbf{DunnSEME} proposes a measurement error model for use in
	method comparison studies. Consider n pairs of measurements
	$X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ for $i=1,2,...n$.
	\begin{equation}
		X_{i} = \tau_{i}+\delta_{i}\\
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		Y_{i} = \alpha +\beta\tau_{i}+\epsilon_{i} \nonumber
	\end{equation}
	
	In the above formulation is in the form of a linear structural
	relationship, with $\tau_{i}$ and $\beta\tau_{i}$ as the true
	values , and $\delta_{i}$ and $\epsilon_{i}$ as the corresponding
	measurement errors. In the case where the units of measurement are
	the same, then $\beta =1$.
	
	\begin{equation}
		E(X_{i}) = \tau_{i}\\
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		E(Y_{i}) = \alpha +\beta\tau_{i} \nonumber
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		E(\delta_{i}) = E(\epsilon_{i}) = 0 \nonumber
	\end{equation}
	
	The value $\alpha$ is the inter-method bias between the two
	methods.
	
	\begin{eqnarray}
		z_0 &=& d = 0 \\
		z_{n+1} &=& z_n^2+c
	\end{eqnarray}

\section{Model Formulation and Formal Testing}

\citet{Kinsella} formulates a model for un-replicated observations
for a method comparison study as a mixed model.
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{ij} =\quad \mu_{j} + S_{i} + \epsilon_{ij} \quad i=1,2...n\quad
j=1,2\\
S \sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_{s})\qquad \epsilon_{ij} \sim
N(0,\sigma^{2}_{j}) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

As with all mixed models, the variance of each observation is the
sum of all the associated variance components.
\begin{eqnarray}
var(Y_{ij}) =\quad \sigma^{2}_{s} + \sigma^{2}_{j} \\
cov(Y_{i1},Y_{i2})=\quad \sigma^{2}_{s} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\citet{Grubbs48} offers maximum likelihood estimators, commonly
known as Grubbs estimators, for the various variance components:
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\sigma^{2}_{s}} \quad= \sum{\frac{(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{n-1}}\quad=Sxy\\
\hat{\sigma^{2}_{1}} \quad= \sum{\frac{(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}} \quad=S^{2}x-Sxy \nonumber\\
\hat{\sigma^{2}_{2}} \quad=
\sum{\frac{(y_{i}-\bar{y})^{2}}{n-1}}\quad=S^{2}y-Sxy \nonumber
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The standard error of these variance estimates are:
\begin{eqnarray}
var(\sigma^{2}_{1}) =\quad \frac{2\sigma^{4}_{1}}{n-1} +\quad
\frac{\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{1}+\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{2}+\sigma^2_{1}\sigma^2_{2}
}{n-1}\\
var(\sigma^{2}_{2}) =\quad \frac{2\sigma^{4}_{2}}{n-1} +\quad
\frac{\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{1}+\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{2}+\sigma^2_{1}\sigma^2_{2}
}{n-1}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\citet{Thompson}presents confidence intervals for the relative
precisions of the measurement methods, $\Delta_{j}=
\sigma^2_{S}/\sigma^2_{j}$ (where $j=1,2$), as well as the
variances $\sigma^{2}_{S}, \sigma^{2}_{1}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{2}$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_{1} >\quad \frac{C_{xy}-
	t(|A|/n-2))^{\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{x}-C_{xy}+
	t(|A|/n-2))^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\end{eqnarray}
where

\begin{eqnarray}
C_{x}=\quad(n-1)S^2_{x}\nonumber\\
C_{xy}=\quad(n-1)S_{xy}\nonumber\\
C_{y}=\quad(n-1)S^2_{y}\nonumber\\
A=\quad C_{x}\times C_{y} - (C_{xy})^2 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

$t$ is the $100(1-\alpha/2)\%$ quantile of Student's $t$
distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. $\Delta_{2}$ can be
found by changing $C_{y}$ for $C_{x}$. A lower confidence limit
can be found by calculating the square root. This inequality may
also be used for hypothesis testing.

For the interval estimates for the variance components,
\citet{Thompson} presents three relations that hold simultaneously
with probability $1-2\alpha$ where $2\alpha=0.01$ or $0.05$.

\begin{eqnarray}
|\sigma^2-C_{xy}K|\leqslant M(C_{x}C_{y})^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
|\sigma^2_{1}-(C_{x}-C_{xy})K|\leqslant M(C_{x}(C_{x}+C_{y}-2C_{xy}))^{\frac{1}{2}}\nonumber\\
|\sigma^2_{2}-(C_{y}-C_{xy})K|\leqslant
M(C_{y}(C_{x}+C_{y}-2C_{xy}))^{\frac{1}{2}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The case-wise differences and means are $D_{i} = Y_{i1}-Y_{i2}$
and $A_{i} = (Y_{i1}+Y_{i2})/2$  respectively. Both $D_{i}$ and
$A_{i}$ follow a bivariate normal distribution with $E(D_{i})=
\mu_{D} = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$ and $E(A_{i})= \mu_{A} = (\mu_{1} +
\mu_{2})/2$. The variance matrix $\Sigma$ is

\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \left[\begin{matrix}
\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2}&\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2})\\
\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2})&\sigma^{2}_{S}+
\frac{1}{4}(\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})
\end{matrix} \right]
\end{equation}





\citet{Kinsella} demonstrates how the Grubbs estimators for the
error variances can be calculated using the difference values,
providing a worked example on a data set.
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\sigma^{2}_{1}}
\quad=\sum{(y_{i1}-\bar{y{1}})(D_{i}-\bar{D})}\\
\hat{\sigma^{2}_{2}} \quad=
\sum{(y_{i2}-\bar{y_{2}})(D_{i}-\bar{D})} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Paired sample T-test} \citet{Bartko} discusses the use
of the well known paired sample $t$ test to test for inter-method
bias; $H: \mu_{D}=0$. The test statistic is distributed a $t$
random variable with $n-1$ degrees of freedom and is calculated as
follows;

\begin{equation}
t^{*} = \bar{D}/ \frac{S_{D}}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{D}$ and $S_{D}$ is the average of the differences of
the $n$ observations.

\subsection{Morgan Pitman}

The test of the hypothesis that the variance of both methods are
equal is based on the correlation value $\rho_{D,A}$ which is
evaluated as follows;

\begin{equation}
\rho(D,A)=\quad\frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2}}{\sqrt{(\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})(4\sigma^{2}_{S}+\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})}}
\end{equation}

The correlation constant takes the value zero if, and only if, the
two variances are equal. Therefore a test of the hypothesis $H:
\sigma^{2}_{1}=\sigma^{2}_{2}$ is equivalent to a test of the
hypothesis $H: \rho(D,A) = 0$. The corresponds to the well-known
$t$ test for a correlation coefficient with $n-2$ degrees of
freedom.

\citet{Bartko} describes the Morgan-Pitman test as identical to
the test of the slope equal to zero in the regression of $Y_{i1}$
on $Y_{12}$, adding that this result can be shown using
straightforward algebra.

%\subsection{Bradley & Blackwood / Pitman-Morgan Testing}
The Pitman-Morgan test for equal variances is based on the correlation of D with S. The correlation coefficient is zero if, and only if, the variances are equal. The test statistic is the familiar t-test with n-2 degree of freedom.
Bradley and Blackwood (1989) construct the conditional expectation of D given S as linear model.  They used this result to propose a test of the joint hypothesis of the mean difference and equal variances. 
If the intercept and slope estimates are zero, the two methods have the same mean and variance.
The Pitman-Morgan test is equivalent to the marginal test of the slope estimate in Bradley-Blackwood’s model.

\subsection{Bartko's Bradley-Blackwood Test}
This is a regression based approach that performs a simulataneous
test for the equivalence of means and variances of the respective
methods.\\
\begin{equation}
D = (X_{1}-X_{2})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M = (X_{1} + X_{2}) /2
\end{equation}
The Bradley Blackwood Procedure fits D on M as follows:\\
\begin{equation}
D = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}M
\end{equation}
\\Both beta values, the intercept and slope, are derived from the respective means and
standard deviations of their respective data sets.\\
We determine if the respective means and variances are equal if
both beta values are simultaneously equal to zero. The Test is
conducted using an F test, calculated from the results of a
regression of D on M.
\\We have identified this approach  to be examined to see if it can
be used as a foundation for a test perform a test on means and
variances individually.\\
Russell et al have suggested this method be used in conjunction
with a paired t-test , with estimates of slope and intercept.

\section{Thompson 1963}



\citet{Thompson} defines $\Delta_{j}$ to be a measure of the
relative precision of the measurement methods, with $\Delta_{j}=
\sigma^2_{S}/\sigma^2_{j}$(where $j=1,2$). Confidence intervals
for $\Delta_{j}$ are also presented.

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_{1} > \frac{C_{xy}-
	t(\frac{|A|}{n-1}))^{\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{x}-C_{xy}+
	t(\frac{|A|}{n-1}))^{\frac{1}{2}}},
\end{eqnarray}
where

\begin{eqnarray}
C_{x}&=&(n-1)S^2_{x},\nonumber\\
C_{xy}&=&(n-1)S_{xy},\nonumber\\
C_{y}&=&(n-1)S^2_{y},\nonumber\\
A &=& C_{x}\times C_{y} - (C_{xy})^2 . \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

The value $t$ is the $100(1-\alpha/2)\%$ quantile of Student's $t$
distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. The ratio $\Delta_{2}$
can be found by interchanging $C_{y}$ and $C_{x}$. A lower
confidence limit can be found by calculating the square root. The
inequality in equation $1.10$ may also be used for hypothesis
testing.

For the interval estimates for the variance components,
\citet{Thompson} presents three relations that hold simultaneously
with probability $1-2\alpha$ where $2\alpha=0.01$ or $0.05$.


\begin{eqnarray*}
	|\sigma^2-C_{xy}K| &\leqslant& M(C_{x}C_{y})^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
	|\sigma^2_{1}-(C_{x}-C_{xy})K|&\leqslant M(C_{x}(C_{x}+C_{y}-2C_{xy}))^{\frac{1}{2}}\nonumber\\
	|\sigma^2_{2}-(C_{y}-C_{xy})K|&\leqslant
	M(C_{y}(C_{x}+C_{y}-2C_{xy}))^{\frac{1}{2}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray*}

\citet{Thompson} contains tables for $K$ and $M$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Bartko's BB
\citet{BB89} offers a formal simultaneous hypothesis test for the
mean and variance of two paired data sets. Using simple linear
regression of the differences of each pair against the sums, a
line is fitted to the model, with estimates for intercept and
slope ($\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}$). The null
hypothesis of this test is that the mean ($\mu$) and variance
($\sigma^{2}$) of both data sets are equal if the slope and
intercept estimates are equal to zero(i.e $\sigma^{2}_{1} =
\sigma^{2}_{2}$ and $\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}$ if and only if $\beta_{0}=
\beta_{1}=0$ )

A test statistic is then calculated from the regression analysis
of variance values \citep{BB89} and is distributed as `F' random
variable. The degrees of freedom thereof are $\nu_{1}=2$ and
$\nu_{1}=n-2$ (where n is the number of pairs). The critical value
is chosen for $\alpha\%$ significance with those same degrees of
freedom. \citet{Bartko} amends this methodology for use in method
comparison studies, using the averages of the pairs, as opposed to
the sums, and their differences. This approach can facilitate
simultaneous usage of test with the Bland-Altman methodology.
Bartko's test statistic take the form:
\begin{equation} F.test = \frac{(\Sigma d^{2})-SSReg}{2MSReg}

%(calculate using R code $qf(0.95,2,10)$).

For the Grubbs data, $\Sigma d^{2}=5.09 $, $SSReg = 0.60$ and
$MSreg=0.06$ Therefore the test statistic is $37.42$, with a
critical value of $4.10$. Hence the means and variance of the
Fotobalk and Counter chronometers are assumed to be simultaneously
equal.

Importantly, this methodology determines whether there is both
inter-method bias and precision present, or alternatively if there
is neither present. It has previously been demonstrated that there
is a inter-method bias present, but as this procedure does not
allow for separate testing, no conclusion can be drawn on the
comparative precision of both methods.

\subsection{Formal Testing}
The Bland Altman plot is a simple tool for inspection of the data,
but in itself it offers no formal testing procedure in this
regard. To this end, the approach proposed by \citet{BA83} is a
formal test on the Pearson correlation coefficient  of casewise
differences and means ($\rho_{AD}$). According to the authors,
this test is equivalent to a well established tests for equality
of variances, known as the `Pitman Morgan Test' \citep{Pitman,
	Morgan}.

For the Grubbs data, the correlation coefficient estimate
($r_{AD}$) is 0.2625, with a 95\% confidence interval of (-0.366,
0.726) estimated by Fishers 'r to z' transformation \citep{Cohen}.
The null hypothesis ($\rho_{AD}$ =0) would fail to be rejected.
Consequently the null hypothesis of equal variances of each method
would also fail to be rejected.

There has no been no further mention of this particular test in
the subsequent article published by Bland and Altman, although
\citet{BA99} refers to Spearmans' rank correlation coefficient.

\section{Bartko's Regression and Ellipse}
\citet{BB89} offers a formal simultaneous hypothesis test for the
mean and variance of two paired data sets. Using simple linear
regression of the differences of each pair against the sums, a
line is fitted to the model, with estimates for intercept and
slope ($\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$). The null hypothesis of this
test is that the mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^{2}$) of both
data sets are equal if the slope and intercept estimates are equal
to zero(i.e $\sigma^{2}_{1} = \sigma^{2}_{2}$ and
$\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}$ if and only if $\beta_{0}= \beta_{1}=0$ )

A test statistic is then calculated from the regression analysis
of variance values \citep{BB89} and is distributed as `F' random
variable. The degrees of freedom thereof are $\nu_{1}=2$ and
$\nu_{1}=n-2$ (where n is the number of pairs). The critical value

using the from the averages of the pairs, as opposed to the sums,

	fixed effects and random effects:

		\citet{Thompson} defines $\Delta_{j}$ to be a measure of the

	\section{Model Formulation and Formal Testing}
	
	\citet{Kinsella} formulates a model for un-replicated observations
	for a method comparison study as a mixed model.
	\begin{eqnarray}
	Y_{ij} =\quad \mu_{j} + S_{i} + \epsilon_{ij} \quad i=1,2...n\quad
	j=1,2\\
	S \sim N(0,\sigma^{2}_{s})\qquad \epsilon_{ij} \sim
	N(0,\sigma^{2}_{j}) \nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	As with all mixed models, the variance of each observation is the
	sum of all the associated variance components.
	\begin{eqnarray}
	var(Y_{ij}) =\quad \sigma^{2}_{s} + \sigma^{2}_{j} \\
	cov(Y_{i1},Y_{i2})=\quad \sigma^{2}_{s} \nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	\citet{Grubbs48} offers maximum likelihood estimators, commonly
	known as Grubbs estimators, for the various variance components:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\hat{\sigma^{2}_{s}} \quad= \sum{\frac{(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{n-1}}\quad=Sxy\\
	\hat{\sigma^{2}_{1}} \quad= \sum{\frac{(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}} \quad=S^{2}x-Sxy \nonumber\\
	\hat{\sigma^{2}_{2}} \quad=
	\sum{\frac{(y_{i}-\bar{y})^{2}}{n-1}}\quad=S^{2}y-Sxy \nonumber
	\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	The standard error of these variance estimates are:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	var(\sigma^{2}_{1}) =\quad \frac{2\sigma^{4}_{1}}{n-1} +\quad
	\frac{\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{1}+\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{2}+\sigma^2_{1}\sigma^2_{2}
	}{n-1}\\
	var(\sigma^{2}_{2}) =\quad \frac{2\sigma^{4}_{2}}{n-1} +\quad
	\frac{\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{1}+\sigma^2_{S}\sigma^2_{2}+\sigma^2_{1}\sigma^2_{2}
	}{n-1}\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	\citet{Thompson}presents confidence intervals for the relative
	precisions of the measurement methods, $\Delta_{j}=
	\sigma^2_{S}/\sigma^2_{j}$ (where $j=1,2$), as well as the
	variances $\sigma^{2}_{S}, \sigma^{2}_{1}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{2}$.
	
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta_{1} >\quad \frac{C_{xy}-
		t(|A|/n-2))^{\frac{1}{2}}}{C_{x}-C_{xy}+
		t(|A|/n-2))^{\frac{1}{2}}}
	\end{eqnarray}
	where
	
	\begin{eqnarray}
	C_{x}=\quad(n-1)S^2_{x}\nonumber\\
	C_{xy}=\quad(n-1)S_{xy}\nonumber\\
	C_{y}=\quad(n-1)S^2_{y}\nonumber\\
	A=\quad C_{x}\times C_{y} - (C_{xy})^2 \nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	$t$ is the $100(1-\alpha/2)\%$ quantile of Student's $t$
	distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. $\Delta_{2}$ can be
	found by changing $C_{y}$ for $C_{x}$. A lower confidence limit
	can be found by calculating the square root. This inequality may
	also be used for hypothesis testing.
	
	For the interval estimates for the variance components,
	\citet{Thompson} presents three relations that hold simultaneously
	with probability $1-2\alpha$ where $2\alpha=0.01$ or $0.05$.
	
	\begin{eqnarray}
	|\sigma^2-C_{xy}K|\leqslant M(C_{x}C_{y})^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
	|\sigma^2_{1}-(C_{x}-C_{xy})K|\leqslant M(C_{x}(C_{x}+C_{y}-2C_{xy}))^{\frac{1}{2}}\nonumber\\
	|\sigma^2_{2}-(C_{y}-C_{xy})K|\leqslant
	M(C_{y}(C_{x}+C_{y}-2C_{xy}))^{\frac{1}{2}}\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	The case-wise differences and means are $D_{i} = Y_{i1}-Y_{i2}$
	and $A_{i} = (Y_{i1}+Y_{i2})/2$  respectively. Both $D_{i}$ and
	$A_{i}$ follow a bivariate normal distribution with $E(D_{i})=
	\mu_{D} = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$ and $E(A_{i})= \mu_{A} = (\mu_{1} +
	\mu_{2})/2$. The variance matrix $\Sigma$ is
	
	\begin{equation}
	\Sigma = \left[\begin{matrix}
	\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2}&\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2})\\
	\frac{1}{2}(\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2})&\sigma^{2}_{S}+
	\frac{1}{4}(\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})
	\end{matrix} \right]
	\end{equation}
	
	
	
	
	
	\citet{Kinsella} demonstrates how the Grubbs estimators for the
	error variances can be calculated using the difference values,
	providing a worked example on a data set.
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\hat{\sigma^{2}_{1}}
	\quad=\sum{(y_{i1}-\bar{y{1}})(D_{i}-\bar{D})}\\
	\hat{\sigma^{2}_{2}} \quad=
	\sum{(y_{i2}-\bar{y_{2}})(D_{i}-\bar{D})} \nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	

	\section{Identifiability}
	\citet{DunnSEME} highlights an important issue regarding using models such as structural equation modelling, which is the identifiability problem. This comes as a
	result of there being too many parameters to be estimated. Therefore assumptions about some parameters, or estimators used, must be made so that others can be estimated. For example, in the literature, the variance ratio $\lambda=\frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}}{\sigma^{2}_{2}}$
	must often be assumed to be equal to $1$ \citep{linnet98}. \citet{DunnSEME} considers approaches based on two methods with single measurements on each subject as inadequate for a serious
	study on the measurement characteristics of the methods. This is because there would not be enough data to allow for a meaningful
	analysis. There is, however, a counter-argument that in many practical settings it is very difficult to get replicate observations when, for example, the measurement method requires invasive medical
	procedure.

	of the variance of two data sets; $\sigma^{2}_{1} =
	\sigma^{2}_{2}$, based on the correlation value $\rho_{a,d}$ ,and
	is evaluated as follows;
	
	\begin{equation}
	\rho(a,d)=\quad\frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2}}{\sqrt{(\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})(4\sigma^{2}_{S}+\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})}}
	\end{equation}
	
	The test of the hypothesis that the variance of both methods are
	equal is based on the correlation value $\rho_{D,A}$ which is
	evaluated as follows;
	
	\begin{equation}
	\rho(D,A)=\quad\frac{\sigma^{2}_{1}-\sigma^{2}_{2}}{\sqrt{(\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})(4\sigma^{2}_{S}+\sigma^{2}_{1}+\sigma^{2}_{2})}}.
	\end{equation}
	
	The correlation constant takes the value zero if, and only if, the
	two variances are equal. Therefore a test of the hypothesis $H:
	\sigma^{2}_{1}=\sigma^{2}_{2}$ is equivalent to a test of the
	hypothesis $H: \rho(D,A) = 0$. The corresponds to the well-known
	$t$ test for a correlation coefficient with $n-2$ degrees of
	freedom.
	
	The basis of this approach is that the
	distribution of the original measurements is bivariate normal.
	Morgan and Pitman noted that the correlation coefficient depends
	upon the difference $\sigma^{2}_{1}- \sigma^{2}_{2}$, being zero
	if and only if $\sigma^{2}_{1}=\sigma^{2}_{2}$.
	
	
	The correlation constant takes the value zero if, and only if, the two variances are equal. Therefore a test of the hypothesis $H: \sigma^{2}_{1}=\sigma^{2}_{2}$ is equivalent to a test of the hypothesis $H: \rho(D,A) = 0$. This corresponds to the well-known
	$t$ test for a correlation coefficient with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. \citet{Bartko} describes the Morgan-Pitman test as identical to
	the test of the slope equal to zero in the regression of $Y_{i1}$ on $Y_{12}$, a result that can be derived using
	straightforward algebra.

			\section{Paired sample \emph{t} test}
			
			\citet{Bartko} discusses the use of the well known paired sample
			$t$ test to test for inter-method bias; $H: \mu_{d}=0$. The test
			statistic is distributed a $t$ random variable with $n-1$ degrees
			of freedom and is calculated as follows,
			
			\begin{equation}
			t^{*} = \frac{\bar{d}}{ \frac{s_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}}
			\end{equation}
			
			where $\bar{d}$ and $s_{d}$ is the average of the differences of
			the $n$ observations. Only if the two methods show comparable
			precision then the paired sample student t-test is appropriate for
			assessing the magnitude of the bias.
			
	\begin{itemize}
		% http://www.jerrydallal.com/LHSP/compare.htm
		\item Paired t tests test only whether the mean responses are the same. Certainly, we want the means to be the same, but this is only a small part of the story. The means can be equal while the (random) differences between measurements can be huge.
		\item The correlation coefficient measures linear agreement--whether the measurements go up-and-down together. Certainly, we want the measures to go up-and-down together, but the correlation coefficient itself is deficient in at least three ways as a measure of agreement.
		The correlation coefficient can be close to 1 (or equal to 1!) even when there is considerable bias between the two methods. For example, if one method gives measurements that are always 10 units higher than the other method, the correlation will be 1 exactly, but the measurements will always be 10 units apart.
		\item The magnitude of the correlation coefficient is affected by the range of subjects/units studied. 
		\item The correlation coefficient can be made smaller by measuring samples that are similar to each other and larger by measuring samples that are very different from each other. The magnitude of the correlation says nothing about the magnitude of the differences between the paired measurements which, when you get right down to it, is all that really matters.
		\item The usual significance test involving a correlation coefficient-- whether the population value is 0--is irrelevant to the comparability problem. What is important is not merely that the correlation coefficient be different from 0. Rather, it should be close to (ideally, equal to) 1!

	\section*{Structural Equation Modelling}
	Authors, such as a \citet{lewis}, \citet{dunnSEME} and \citet{voelkel2005center}, strongly advocate the use of \textit{Structural Equation Models} for the purposes of method comparison. Conversely \citet{BA99} also states that consider structural equation models to be inappropriate.

	\section{Regression Methods for Method Comparison}
	Conventional regression models are estimated using the ordinary
	least squares (OLS) technique, and are referred to as `Model I
	regression' \citep{CornCoch,ludbrook97}. A key feature of Model I
	models is that the independent variable is assumed to be measured
	without error. However this assumption invalidates simple linear
	regression for use in method comparison studies, as both methods
	must be assumed to be measured with error \citep{BA83,ludbrook97}.

		\section{Regression Methods}
		Conventional regression models are estimated using the ordinary
		least squares (OLS) technique, and are referred to as `Model I
		regression' \citep{CornCoch,ludbrook97}. A key feature of Model I
		models is that the independent variable is assumed to be measured
		without error. As often pointed out in several papers
		\citep{BA83,ludbrook97}, this assumption invalidates simple linear
		regression for use in method comparison studies, as both methods
		must be assumed to be measured with error.
		
		The use of regression models that assumes the presence of error in
		both variables $X$ and $Y$ have been proposed for use instead
		\citep{CornCoch,ludbrook97}. These methodologies are collectively
		known as `Model II regression'. They differ in the method used to
		estimate the parameters of the regression.
		
		Regression estimates depend on formulation of the model. A
		formulation with one method considered as the $X$ variable will
		yield different estimates for a formulation where it is the $Y$
		variable. With Model I regression, the models fitted in both cases
		will entirely different and inconsistent. However with Model II
		regression, they will be consistent and complementary.
		
		Regression approaches are useful for a making a detailed examination of the biases across the range of measurements, allowing bias to be decomposed into fixed bias and proportional bias.
		Fixed bias describes the case where one method gives values that are consistently different
		to the other across the whole range. Proportional
		bias describes the difference in measurements getting progressively greater, or smaller, across the range of measurements. A measurement method may have either an attendant fixed bias or proportional bias, or both. \citep{ludbrook}. Determination of these biases shall be discussed in due course.

	\section{Bartko's Regression and Ellipse}
	\citet{BB89} offers a formal simultaneous hypothesis test for the
	mean and variance of two paired data sets. Using simple linear
	regression of the differences of each pair against the sums, a
	line is fitted to the model, with estimates for intercept and
	slope ($\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$). The null hypothesis of this
	test is that the mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^{2}$) of both
	data sets are equal if the slope and intercept estimates are equal
	to zero(i.e $\sigma^{2}_{1} = \sigma^{2}_{2}$ and
	$\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}$ if and only if $\beta_{0}= \beta_{1}=0$ )
	
	A test statistic is then calculated from the regression analysis
	of variance values \citep{BB89} and is distributed as `F' random
	variable. The degrees of freedom thereof are $\nu_{1}=2$ and
	$\nu_{1}=n-2$ (where n is the number of pairs). The critical value
	is chosen for $\alpha\%$ significance with those same degrees of
	freedom. \citet{Bartko} amends this metholodogy for calculation
	using the from the averages of the pairs, as opposed to the sums,
	and their differences. This would facilitate simultaneous usage of
	test with the Bland Altman methodology. Bartko's test statistic
	take the form:
	\begin{equation} F.test = \frac{(\Sigma D^{2})-SSReg}{2MSReg}

	\section{Blackwood -Bradley Model} 
	
	\citet{BB89} have developed a regression based procedure for
	assessing the agreement. This approach performs a simultaneous test for the equivalence of
	means and variances of the respective methods. Using simple linear
	regression of the differences of each pair against the sums, a
	line is fitted to the model, with estimates for intercept and
	slope ($\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}$).
	%We have identified
	%this approach  to be examined to see if it can be used as a %foundation for a test perform a test on
	%means and variances individually.
	\begin{equation}
		D = (X_{1}-X_{2})
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		M = (X_{1} + X_{2}) /2
	\end{equation}
	The Bradley Blackwood Procedure fits D on M as follows:\\
	\begin{equation}
		D = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}M
	\end{equation}
	This technique offers a formal simultaneous hypothesis test for the
	mean and variance of two paired data sets.  The null
	hypothesis of this test is that the mean ($\mu$) and variance
	($\sigma^{2}$) of both data sets are equal if the slope and
	intercept estimates are equal to zero(i.e $\sigma^{2}_{1} =
	\sigma^{2}_{2}$ and $\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}$ if and only if $\beta_{0}=
	\beta_{1}=0$ )
	
	A test statistic is then calculated from the regression analysis
	of variance values \citep{BB89} and is distributed as `$F$' random
	variable. The degrees of freedom are $\nu_{1}=2$ and $\nu_{1}=n-2$
	(where $n$ is the number of pairs). The critical value is chosen
	for $\alpha\%$ significance with those same degrees of freedom.
	\citet{Bartko} amends this approach for use in method
	comparison studies, using the averages of the pairs, as opposed to
	the sums, and their differences. This approach can facilitate
	simultaneous usage of test with the Bland-Altman approach.

	\section{Bradley-Blackwood Test (Kevin Hayes Talk)}
	%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	% KH - UW
	
	This work considers the problem of testing $\mu_1$ = $\mu_2$ and $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$ using a random sample from a bivariate normal distribution with parameters $(\mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma^2_1, \sigma^2_2, \rho)$. 
	
	The new contribution is a decomposition of the Bradley-Blackwood test statistic (\textit{Bradley and Blackwood, 1989})for the simultaneous test of {$\mu_1$ = $\mu_2$; $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$}  as a sum of two statistics. 
	
	One is equivalent to the Pitman-Morgan (\textit{Pitman, 1939; Morgan, 1939}) test statistic 
	for $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$ and the other one is a new alternative to the standard paired-t test of $\mu_D = \mu_1 = \mu_2 = 0$. 
	
	Surprisingly, the classic Student paired-t test makes no assumptions about the equality (or otherwise) of the 
	variance parameters. 
	
	The power functions for these tests are quite easy to derive, and show that when $\sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2$, 
	the paired t-test has a slight advantage over the new alternative in terms of power, but when $\sigma^2_1 \neq \sigma^2_2$, the 
	new test has substantially higher power than the paired-t test.
	
	While Bradley and Blackwood provide a test on the joint hypothesis of equal means and equal variances their regression based approach does not separate these two issues.
	
	The rejection of the joint hypothesis may be 
	due to two groups with unequal means and unequal variances; unequal means and equal variances, or equal means and unequal variances. We propose an approach for resolving this (model selection) problem in a manner controlling the magnitudes of the relevant type I error probabilities.
	
	

	\section{Deming Regression}
	
	As stated previously, the fundamental flaw of simple linear regression is that it allows for measurement error in one variable only. This causes a downward biased slope estimate.
	
	Deming regression is a regression fitting approach that assumes error in both variables. Deming regression is recommended by \citet*{CornCoch} as the
	preferred Model II regression for use in method comparison studies.
	The sum of squared distances from measured sets of values to the regression line is minimized at an angles specified by the ratio $\lambda$ of the residual variance of both variables. I
	When $\lambda$ is one, the angle is 45 degrees. In ordinary linear regression, the distances are minimized in the vertical directions \citep{linnet99}.
	In cases involving only single measurements by each method, $\lambda$ may be unknown and is therefore assumes a value of one. While this will produce biased estimates, they are less biased than ordinary linear regression.
	
	The Bland Altman Plot is uninformative about the comparative influence of proportional bias and fixed bias. Model II approaches, such as Deming regression,  can provide independent tests for
	both types of bias.
	
	For a given $\lambda$, \citet{Kummel} derived the following estimate that would later be used for the Deming regression slope
	parameter. The intercept estimate $\alpha$ is simply estimated in the same way as in conventional linear
	regression, by using the identity $\bar{Y}-\hat{\beta}\bar{X}$;
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{\beta} =\quad \frac{S_{yy} - \lambda S_{xx}+[(S_{yy} -
			\lambda S_{xx})^{2}+ 4\lambda S^{2}_{xy}]^{1/2}}{2S_{xy}}
	\end{equation},
	with $\lambda$ as the variance ratio. As stated previously $\lambda$ is often unknown, and therefore must be assumed to equal one. \citet{CarollRupert} states that Deming
	regression is acceptable only when the precision ratio ($\lambda$,in their paper as $\eta$) is correctly specified, but in practice this is often not the case, with the $\lambda$ being underestimated. Several candidate models, with varying variance ratios may be fitted, and estimates of the slope and intercept are produced. However no model selection information is available to determine the best fitting model.
	
	As with conventional regression methodologies, Deming regression calculates an estimate for both the slope and intercept for the
	fitted line, and standard errors thereof. Therefore there is sufficient information to carry out hypothesis tests on both
	estimates, that are informative about presence of fixed and proportional bias.
	
	A $95\%$ confidence interval for the intercept estimate can be used to test the intercept, and hence fixed bias, is equal to
	zero. This hypothesis is accepted if the confidence interval for the estimate contains the value $0$ in its range. Should this be,
	it can be concluded that fixed bias is not present. Conversely, if the hypothesis is rejected, then it is concluded that the
	intercept is non zero, and that fixed bias is present.
	
	Testing for proportional bias is a very similar procedure. The
	$95\%$ confidence interval for the slope estimate can be used to
	test the hypothesis that the slope is equal to $1$. This
	hypothesis is accepted if the confidence interval for the estimate
	contains the value $1$ in its range. If the hypothesis is
	rejected, then it is concluded that the slope is significant
	different from $1$ and that a proportional bias exists.
	
	For convenience, a new data set shall be introduced to demonstrate
	Deming regression. Measurements of transmitral volumetric flow
	(MF) by doppler echocardiography, and left ventricular stroke
	volume (SV) by cross sectional echocardiography in 21 patients
	with aortic valve disease are tabulated in \citet{zhang}. This
	data set features in the discussion of method comparison studies
	in \citet[p.398]{AltmanBook} .

		\section{Other Types of Studies / gold Standards}
		\citet{lewis} categorize method comparison studies into three
		different types.  The key difference between the first two is
		whether or not a `gold standard' method is used. In situations
		where one instrument or method is known to be `accurate and
		precise', it is considered as the`gold standard' \citep{lewis}. A
		method that is not considered to be a gold standard is referred to
		as an `approximate method'. In calibration studies they are
		referred to a criterion methods and test methods respectively.
		
		
		\textbf{1. Calibration problems}. The purpose is to establish a
		relationship between methods, one of which is an approximate
		method, the other a gold standard. The results of the approximate
		method can be mapped to a known probability distribution of the
		results of the gold standard \citep{lewis}. (In such studies, the
		gold standard method and corresponding approximate method are
		generally referred to a criterion method and test method
		respectively.) \citet*{BA83} make clear that their methodology is
		not intended for calibration problems.
		
		\bigskip \textbf{2. Comparison problems}. When two approximate
		methods, that use the same units of measurement, are to be
		compared. This is the case which the Bland-Altman methodology is
		specfically intended for, and therefore it is the most relevant of
		the three.
		
		\bigskip \textbf{3. Conversion problems}. When two approximate
		methods, that use different units of measurement, are to be
		compared. This situation would arise when the measurement methods
		use 'different proxies', i.e different mechanisms of measurement.
		\citet{lewis} deals specifically with this issue. In the context
		of this study, it is the least relevant of the three.
		
		\citet[p.47]{DunnSEME} cautions that`gold standards' should not be
		assumed to be error free. `It is of necessity a subjective
		decision when we come to decide that a particular method or
		instrument can be treated as if it was a gold standard'. The
		clinician gold standard , the sphygmomanometer, is used as an
		example thereof.  The sphygmomanometer `leaves considerable room
		for improvement' \citep{DunnSEME}. \citet{pizzi} similarly
		addresses the issue of glod standards, `well-established gold
		standard may itself be imprecise or even unreliable'.
		
		
		The NIST F1 Caesium fountain atomic clock is considered to be the
		gold standard when measuring time, and is the primary time and
		frequency standard for the United States. The NIST F1 is accurate
		to within one second per 60 million years \citep{NIST}.
		
		Measurements of the interior of the human body are, by definition,
		invasive medical procedures. The design of method must balance the
		need for accuracy of measurement with the well-being of the
		patient. This will inevitably lead to the measurement error as
		described by \citet{DunnSEME}. The magnetic resonance angiogram,
		used to measure internal anatomy,  is considered to the gold
		standard for measuring aortic dissection. Medical test based upon
		the angiogram is reported to have a false positive reporting rate
		of 5\% and a false negative reporting rate of 8\%. This is
		reported as sensitivity of 95\% and a specificity of 92\%
		\citep{ACR}.
		
		In literature they are, perhaps more accurately, referred to as
		`fuzzy gold standards' \citep{phelps}. Consequently when one of the methods is
		essentially a fuzzy gold standard, as opposed to a `true' gold
		standard, the comparison of the criterion and test methods should
		be consider in the context of a comparison study, as well as of a
		calibration study.

\chapter{Repeated Measurements and Repeatability}
	
	
	
	\section{Definition of Replicate measurements}
	Further to \citet{BA99}, a formal definition is required of what exactly replicate measurements are
	
	\emph{By replicates we mean two or more measurements on the same
		individual taken in identical conditions. In general this requirement means that the
		measurements are taken in quick succession.}
	
	Roy accords with Bland and Altman?s definition of a replicate, as being two or more measurements on the same individual under identical conditions. Roy allows the assumption that replicated measurements are equi-correlated. Roy allows unequal numbers of replicates.
	
	Replicate measurements are linked over time. However the method can be easily extended to cover situations where they are not linked over time.
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%

	\section{Statistical Model For Replicate Measurements}
	Let $y_{Aij}$ and $y_{Bij}$ be the $j$th repeated observations of the variables of interest $A$ and $B$ taken on the $i$th subject. The number of repeated measurements for each variable may differ for each individual.
	Both variables are measured on each time points. Let $n_{i}$ be the number of observations for each variable, hence $2\times n_{i}$ observations in total.
	
	It is assumed that the pair $y_{Aij}$ and $y_{Bij}$ follow a bivariate normal distribution.
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	y_{Aij} \\
	y_{Bij} \\
	\end{array}
	\right) \sim \mathcal{N}(
	\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})\mbox{   where } \boldsymbol{\mu} = \left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	\mu_{A} \\
	\mu_{B} \\
	\end{array}
	\right)
	\end{eqnarray}
	The matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ represents the variance component matrix between response variables at a given time point $j$.
	\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
	\sigma^2_{A} & \sigma_{AB} \\
	\sigma_{AB} & \sigma^2_{B}\\
	\end{array}\right)
	\end{equation}
	$\sigma^2_{A}$ is the variance of variable $A$, $\sigma^2_{B}$ is the variance of variable $B$ and $\sigma_{AB}$ is the covariance of the two variable. It is assumed that $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ does not depend on a particular time point, and is the same over all time points.
	
	

	\section{Model for replicate measurements}
	
	We generalize the single measurement model for the replicate measurement case, by additionally specifying replicate values. Let $y_{mir}$ be the $r-$th replicate measurement for subject ``i" made by method ``m". Further to \citet{barnhart} fixed effect can be expressed with a single term $\alpha_{mi}$, which incorporate the true value $\mu_i$.
	
	\[ y_{mir} = \mu_{i} + \alpha_{m} + e_{mir}  \]
	
	Combining fixed effects \citep{barnhart}, we write,
	
	\[ y_{mir} = \alpha_{mi} + e_{mir}.\]
	
	The following assumptions are required
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $e_{mir}$ is independent of the fixed effects with mean $\mbox{E}(e_{mir}) = 0$.
		\item Further to \citet{barnhart} between-item and within-item variances $\mbox{Var}(\alpha_{mi}) = \sigma^2_{Bm}$ and $\mbox{Var}(e_{mir}) = \sigma^2_{Wm}$
		%	\item In keeping with \citet{Roy}, these variance shall be considered as part of the between-item variance covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{D}$ and the within-item variance covariance matrix  $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$
		%	respectively, and will be denoted accordingly ( i.e. $d^2_{m}$ and $\sigma^2_{m}$).
		%	\item Additionally, the total variability of method "m", denoted $\omega^2_m$ is the sum of the within-item and between-item variabilities.
		%	
		%	\[ \omega^2_m = d^2_{m}+ \sigma^2_{m} \]
		
	\end{itemize}


	
	\section{Two Way ANOVA}
	
	\citet{BXC2008} develop their model from a standard two-way analysis of variance model, reformulated for the case of replicate measurements, with random effects terms specified as appropriate. 
	Their model describing $y_{mir} $, again the $r$th replicate measurement on the $i$th item by the $m$th method ($m=1,2,$ $i=1,\ldots,N,$ and $r = 1,\ldots,n$), can be written as
	\begin{equation}\label{BXC-model}
		y_{mir}  = \alpha_{m} + \mu_{i} + a_{ir} + c_{mi} + \epsilon_{mir}.
	\end{equation}
	The fixed effects $\alpha_{m}$ and $\mu_{i}$  represent the intercept for method $m$ and the `true value' for item $i$ respectively. The random-effect terms comprise an item-by-replicate interaction term $a_{ir} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\varsigma^{2})$, a method-by-item interaction term $c_{mi} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\tau^{2}_{m}),$ and model error terms $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\varphi^{2}_{m}).$ All random-effect terms are assumed to be independent.
	For the case when replicate measurements are assumed to be exchangeable for item $i$, $a_{ir}$ can be removed.
	
	The model expressed in (2) describes measurements by $m$ methods, where $m = \{1,2,3\ldots\}$. Based on the model expressed in (2), \citet{BXC2008} compute the limits of agreement as
	\[
	\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 \pm 2 \sqrt{ \tau^2_1 +  \tau^2_2 +  \varphi^2_1 +  \varphi^2_2 }
	\]
	\citet{BXC2008} notes that, for $m=2$,  separate estimates of $\tau^2_m$ can not be obtained. To overcome this, the assumption of equality, i.e. $\tau^2_1 = \tau^2_2$ is required.
	
	
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	\section{Replicate measurements}
	\citet{ARoy2009} accords with Bland and Altman?s definition of a replicate, as being two or more measurements on the same individual under identical conditions.
	Roy allows the assumption that replicated measurements are equi-correlated.
	Roy allows unequal numbers of replicates.

	
	Replicate measurements are linked over time. However the method can be easily extended to cover situations where they are not linked over time.
	
	Repeated measurements are said to be linked if a direct correspondence exists between successive measurements across measurements, i.e. pairing. Such measurements are commonly made with a time interval between them, but simultaneously for both methods. Paired measurements are exchangeable, but individual measurements are not.
	
	If the paired measurements are taken
	in a short period of time so that no real systemic changes can take place on each item, they can be considered true replicates.
	Should enough time elapse for systemic changes, linked repeated measurements can not be treated as true replicates.
	
	
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	In this model , the variances of the random effects must depend on
	$m$, since the different methods do not necessarily measure on the
	same scale, and different methods naturally must be assumed to
	have different variances. \citet{BXC2004} attends to the issue of
	comparative variances.
	

		
	\bigskip
	\citet{BA99} also remark that an important feature of replicate observations is that they should be independent
	of each other. This issue is addressed by \citet{BXC2010}, in terms of exchangeability and linkage. Carstenen advises that repeated measurements come in two \emph{substantially different} forms, depending on the circumstances of their measurement: exchangable and linked.
	\section{Linkage}
	Repeated measurements are said to be linked if a direct correspondence exists between successive measurements across measurements, i.e. pairing. Such measurements are commonly made with a time interval between them, but simultaneously for both methods. Paired measurements are exchangeable, but individual measurements are not.
	
	If the paired measurements are taken
	in a short period of time so that no real systemic changes can take place on each item, they can be considered true replicates.
	Should enough time elapse for systemic changes, linked repeated measurements can not be treated as true replicates.
	
	
	
	\section{Linked replicates}
	
	\citet{BXC2008} proposes the addition of an random effects term to their model when the replicates are linked. This term is used to describe the `item by replicate' interaction, which is independent of the methods. This interaction is a source of variability independent of the methods. Therefore failure to account for it will result in variability being wrongly attributed to the methods.
	
	\citet{BXC2008} introduces a second data set; the oximetry study. This study done at the Royal Children�s Hospital in
	Melbourne to assess the agreement between co-oximetry and pulse oximetry in small babies.
	
	In most cases, measurements were taken by both method at three different times. In some cases there are either one or two pairs of measurements, hence the data is unbalanced. \citet{BXC2008} describes many of the children as being very sick, and with very low oxygen saturations levels. Therefore it must be assumed that a biological change can occur in interim periods, and measurements are not true replicates.
	
	\citet{BXC2008} demonstrate the necessity of accounting for linked replicated by comparing the limits of agreement from the `oximetry' data set using a model with the additional term, and one without. When the interaction is accounted for the limits of agreement are (-9.62,14.56). When the interaction is not accounted for, the limits of agreement are (-11.88,16.83). It is shown that the failure to include this additional term results in an over-estimation of the standard deviations of differences.
	
	Limits of agreement are determined using Roy's methodology, without adding any additional terms, are found to be consistent with the `interaction' model; $(-9.562, 14.504 )$. Roy's methodology assumes that replicates are linked. However, following Carstensen's example, an addition interaction term is added to the implementation of Roy's model to assess the effect, the limits of agreement estimates do not change. However there is a conspicuous difference in within-subject matrices of Roy's model and the modified model (denoted $1$ and $2$ respectively);
	\begin{equation}
	\hat{\boldsymbol{\Lambda}}_{1}= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
	16.61 &	11.67\\
	11.67 & 27.65 \end{array}\right) \qquad
	\boldsymbol{\hat{\Lambda}}_{2}= \left( \begin{array}{cc}
	7.55 & 2.60 \\
	2.60 & 18.59 \end{array} \right). 
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent (The variance of the additional random effect in model $2$ is $3.01$.)
	
	\citet{akaike} introduces the Akaike information criterion ($AIC$), a model 
	selection tool based on the likelihood function. Given a data set, candidate models
	are ranked according to their AIC values, with the model having the lowest AIC being considered the best fit.Two candidate models can said to be equally good if there is a difference of less than $2$ in their AIC values.
	
	The Akaike information criterion (AIC) for both models are $AIC_{1} = 2304.226$ and $AIC_{2} = 2306.226$ , indicating little difference in models. The AIC values for the Carstensen `unlinked' and `linked' models are $1994.66$ and $1955.48$ respectively, indicating an improvement by adding the interaction term.
	
	The $\boldsymbol{\hat{\Lambda}}$ matrices are informative as to the difference between Carstensen's unlinked and linked models. For the oximetry data, the covariance terms (given above as 11.67 and 2.6 respectively ) are of similar magnitudes to the variance terms. Conversely for the `fat' data the covariance term ($-0.00032$) is negligible. When the interaction term is added to the model, the covariance term remains negligible. (For the `fat' data, the difference in AIC values is also approximately $2$).
	
	To conclude, Carstensen's models provided a rigorous way to determine limits of agreement, but don't provide for the computation of $\boldsymbol{\hat{D}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\hat{\Lambda}}$. Therefore the test's proposed by \citet{roy} can not be implemented. Conversely, accurate limits of agreement as determined by Carstensen's model may also be found using Roy's method. Addition of the interaction term erodes the capability of Roy's methodology to compare candidate models, and therefore shall not be adopted.
	
	Finally, to complement the blood pressure (i.e.`J vs S') method comparison from the previous section (i.e.`J vs S'), the limits of agreement are $15.62 \pm 1.96 \times 20.33 = (-24.22, 55.46)$.)
	\newpage
	
	\section{Exchangeable and Linked measurements}
	
	
	Repeated measurements are said to be exchangeable if no relationship exists between successive measurements across measurements. If the condition of exchangeability exists, a group of measurement of the same item determined by the same method can be re-arranged in any permutation without prejudice to proper analysis. There is no reason to believe that the true value of the underlying variable has changed over the course of the measurements.

	Exchangeable repeated measurements can be treated as true replicates. For the purposes of method comparison studies the following remarks can be made. The $r-$th measurement made by method $1$ has no special correspondence to the $r-$th measurement made by method $2$, and consequently any pairing of repeated measurements are as good as each other.
	
	
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%

	
	Replicate measurements are linked over time. However the method can be easily extended to cover situations where they are not linked over time.
	
		
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	
	
	\section{Replicate Measurements}
	
	Thus far, the formulation for comparison of two measurement
	methods is one where one measurement by each method is taken on
	each subject. Should there be two or more measurements by each
	methods, these measurement are known as `replicate measurements'.
	\citet{BXC2008} recommends the use of replicate measurements, but
	acknowledges the additional computational complexity.
	
	\citet*{BA86} address this problem by offering two different
	approaches. The premise of the first approach is that replicate
	measurements can be treated as independent measurements. The
	second approach is based upon using the mean of the each group of
	replicates as a representative value of that group. Using either
	of these approaches will allow an analyst to estimate the inter
	method bias.
	
	%\section{Mean of Replicates Limits of Agreement}
	
	However, because of the removal of the effects of the replicate
	measurements error, this would cause the estimation of the
	standard deviation of the differences to be unduly small.
	\citet*{BA86} propose a correction for this.
	
	\citet{BXC2008} takes issue with the limits of agreement based on
	mean values of replicate measurements, in that they can only be interpreted as prediction
	limits for difference between means of repeated measurements by
	both methods, as opposed to the difference of all measurements.
	Incorrect conclusions would be caused by such a misinterpretation.
	\citet{BXC2008} demonstrates how the limits of agreement
	calculated using the mean of replicates are `much too narrow as
	prediction limits for differences between future single
	measurements'. This paper also comments that, while treating the
	replicate measurements as independent will cause a downward bias
	on the limits of agreement calculation, this method is preferable
	to the `mean of replicates' approach.

	\section{Repeatability}
	As mentioned previously, \citet{Barnhart} emphasizes the importance of repeatability as part of an overall method comparison study. The coefficient of repeatability was proposed by \citet{BA99}, and is referenced in subsequent papers, such as \citet{BXC2008}. The coefficient of repeatability is a measure of how well a
	measurement method agrees with itself over replicate measurements
	\citep{BA99}. The coefficient of repeatability is a measure of how well a
	measurement method agrees with itself over replicate measurements
	\citep{BA99}. Once the the standard deviations of the differences between the two measurements (in some texts called the residual standard deviation or within-item variability) $sigma_m$ is determined, the
	computation of the coefficients of repeatability for both methods
	is straightforward. The coefficient is calculated from the (in some texts called the residual standard deviation) as  $1.96 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sigma_m$ = $2.83 \sigma_m$).
	
		\section{Repeatability}
		Repeatability is the ability of a measurement method to give consistent results for a particular subject, i.e. a measurement will agree with prior and subsequent measurements of the same subject. \citet{Barnhart} emphasizes the importance of repeatability as part of an overall method comparison study, a view endorsed by \citet{BXC2008}. Before there can be good agreement between two methods, a method must have good agreement with itself. If one method has poor repeatability in the sense of considerable
		variability, then agreement between two methods is bound to be
		poor \citep{ARoy2009}. \citet{Barnhart} remarks that it is important to report repeatability when assessing
		measurement, because it measures the purest form of random error
		not influenced by other factors, while further remarking `\textit{curiously replicate measurements are rarely made in method comparison studies, so that an important aspect of comparability is often overlooked}. \citet{BA99} strongly recommends the simultaneous estimation of repeatability and agreement be collecting replicated data.
		However \citet{ARoy2009} notes the lack of convenience in such calculations. 	Repeatability is defined by the \citet{IUPAC} as `\textit{the closeness of agreement between independent results obtained with the same method on identical test material, under the same conditions (same
			operator, same apparatus, same laboratory and after short intervals of time)}'  and is determined by taking multiple measurements on a series of subjects.
		
		
		
		% %	Test-retest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring of conditions.
		
		A measurement is said to be repeatable when this variation is smaller than some pre-specified limit. In these situations, there is often a predetermined ``critical difference", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in diseases or treatments. 
		
		
		The British Standards Institute (1979) defines a coefficient of repeatability  as \emph{the value below which the difference between two single test results may be expected to lie within a specified probability.} In the absence of other indications, the probability is 95\%.
		

	\section{What is Repeatability}
	The quality of repeatability is the ability of a measurement method to give consistent results for a particular subject. That is to say that a measurement will agree with prior and subsequent measurements of the same subject.

\bigskip
	Repeatability (or \textit{test-retest reliability})  describes the variation in measurements taken by a single method of measurement on the same item and under the same conditions. 
	A less-than-perfect test-retest reliability causes test-retest variability. Such variability can be caused by, for example, intra-individual variability and intra-observer variability. 
	A measurement may be said to be repeatable when this variation is smaller than some agreed limit.
	
	Test-retest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring of conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined "critical difference", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in diseases or treatments.
	
	According to the \textit{Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results}, the following conditions need to be fulfilled in the establishment of repeatability:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	the same measurement procedure
		\item	the same observer
		\item	the same measuring instrument, used under the same conditions
		\item	the same location
		\item	repetition over a short period of time.
		\item  same objectives
	\end{itemize}
	\bigskip
	
	Repeatability is defined by the \textbf{IUPAC} as `\textit{the closeness of agreement between independent results obtained with the same method on identical test material, under the same conditions (same
		operator, same apparatus, same laboratory and after short intervals of time)}'  and is determined by taking multiple measurements on a series of subjects.
	
	A measurement method can be said to have a good level of repeatability if there is consistency in repeated measurements on the same subject using that method. Conversely, a method has poor repeatability if there is considerable variation in repeated measurements.
	
	
	
	%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\newpage
	\section{Coefficient of Repeatability - Good}
	The coefficient of repeatability is a measure of how well a
	measurement method agrees with itself over replicate measurements
	\citep{BA99}. Once the within-item variability is known, the
	computation of the coefficients of repeatability for both methods
	is straightforward.
	
	The British standards Insitute [$1979$] define a coefficient of
	repeatability  as \emph{the value below which the difference between two single test results....may be expected to lie within a specified probability.} Unless otherwise instructed, the
	probability is assumed to be $95\%$. 
	
	The Bland Altman method offers a measurement on the repeatability of the methods. The \emph{Coefficient of Repeatability} (CR) can be calculated as 1.96 (or 2) times the standard deviations of the differences between the two measurements ($d_2$ and $d_1$).
	
	
	
	
	
	%	If one method has poor repeatability in the sense of considerable variability, then agreement between two methods is bound to be poor \citep{ARoy2009}.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\section{Repeatability coefficient}
	\citet{BA99} introduces the repeatability coefficient for a method, which is defined as the upper limits of a prediction interval for the absolute difference between two measurements by the same
	method on the same item under identical circumstances \citep{BXC2008}.
	
	$\sigma^2_{x}$ is the within-subject variance of method $x$. The repeatability coefficient is $2.77 \sigma_{x}$ (i.e. $1.96 \times \sqrt{2} \sigma_{x}$). For $95\%$ of subjects, two replicated measurement by the same method will be within this repeatability coefficient.
	





		\section{Repeatability and Gold Standards}
		Currently the phrase `gold standard' describes the most accurate method of measurement available. No other criteria are set out. Further to \citet{dunnSEME}, various gold standards have a varying levels of repeatability. Dunn cites the example of the sphygmomanometer, which is prone to measurement error. Consequently it can be said that a measurement method can be the `gold standard', yet have poor repeatability. 
		
		% % % Bronze Standard
		\citet{dunnSEME} recognizes  this problem. Hence, if the most accurate method is considered to have poor repeatability, it is referred to as a ``bronze standard".  Again, no formal definition of a `bronze standard' exists.
		
		The coefficient of repeatability may provide the basis of formulation a formal definition of a `gold standard'. For example, by determining the ratio of $CR$ to the sample mean $\bar{X}$. Advisably the sample size should specified in advance. A gold standard may be defined as the method with the lowest value of $\lambda = CR /\bar{X}$ with $\lambda < 0.1\%$. Similarly, a silver standard may be defined as the method with the lowest value of $\lambda $ with $0.1\% \leq \lambda < 1\%$. Such thresholds are solely for expository purposes.
		

	\section{Importance of Repeatability in MCS}
	
	
	
	Barnhart emphasizes the importance of repeatability as part of an overall method comparison study. Before there can be good agreement between two methods, a method must have good agreement with itself. The coefficient of repeatability , as proposed by Bland \& Altman (1999) is an important feature of both Carstensen's and Roy's methodologies. The coefficient is calculated from the residual standard deviation (i.e. $1.96 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sigma_m$ = $2.83 \sigma_m$).

	%% Who Said Next Line
	importance of repeatability' curiously replicate measurements are rarely made in method comparison studies, so that an important aspect of comparability is often overlooked.
	
	Repeatability is important in the context of method comparison because the repeatability of two methods influence the amount of agreement which is possible between those methods. If one method has poor repeatability, the agreement is bound to be poor. If both methods have poor repeatability, agreement is even worse. If one method has poor repeatability in the sense of considerable variability, then agreement between two methods is bound to be poor \citep{ARoy2009}.
	
	\citet{barnhart} and \citet{roy} highlight the importance of reporting repeatability in method comparison, because it measures the purest random error not influenced by any external factors. Statistical procedures on within-subject variances of two methods are equivalent to tests on their respective repeatability coefficients. A formal test is introduced by \citet{roy}, which will discussed in due course.
	
	%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
	%\section{Bland and Altman 1999}
	As noted by Bland and Altman 1999, the repeatability of two methods of measurement can  potentially limit
	Repeatability (using Bland-Altman plot)
	The Bland-Altman plot may also be used to assess a method?s repeatability by comparing repeated measurements using one single measurement method on a sample of items.
	The plot can then also be used to check whether the variability or precision of a method is related to the size of the characteristic being measured.
	Since for the repeated measurements the same method is used, the mean difference should be zero.
	Therefore the Coefficient of Repeatability (CR) can be calculated as 1.96 (often rounded to 2) times the standard deviation of the case-wise differences.

	\section{Notes from BXC Book (chapter 9)}
	The assessment of method-specific repeatability and reproducibility is of interest in its own right.
	Repeatability and reproducibility can only be assessed when replicate measurements by each method are available.
	If replicate measurements by a method are available, it is simple to estimate the measurement error for a method, using a model with fixed effects for item, then taking the residual standard deviation as measurement error standard deviation.
	However, if replicates are linked, this may produce an estimate that biased upwards.
	The repeatability coefficient (or simply repeatability) for a method is defined as the upper limit of a
	prediction interval for the absolute difference between two measurements by the same method on the same
	item under identical circumstances (see above conditions)

	\section{Sampling Scheme : Linked and Unlinked Replicates}
	Measurements taken in quick succession by the same observer using the same instrument on the same subject can be considered true replicates. \citet{ARoy2009} notes that some measurements may not be `true' replicates.
	
	Roy's methodology assumes the use of `true replicates'. However data may not be collected in this way. In such cases, the correlation matrix on the replicates may require a different structure, such as the autoregressive order one $AR(1)$ structure. However determining MLEs with such a structure would be computational intense, if possible at all.
	
	
	
	\emph{
		One important feature of replicate observations is that they should be independent
		of each other. In essence, this is achieved by ensuring that the observer makes each
		measurement independent of knowledge of the previous value(s). This may be difficult
		to achieve in practice.} (Check who said this

	\section{Repeated Measurements in LME models}
	
	In many statistical analyzes, the need to determine parameter estimates where multiple measurements are available on each of a set of variables often arises. Further to \citet{lam}, \citet{hamlett} performs an analysis of the correlation of replicate measurements, for two variables of interest, using LME models.
	
	Let $y_{Aij}$ and $y_{Bij}$ be the $j$th repeated observations of the variables of interest $A$ and $B$ taken on the $i$th subject. The number of repeated measurements for each variable may differ for each individual.
	Both variables are measured on each time points. Let $n_{i}$ be the number of observations for each variable, hence $2\times n_{i}$ observations in total.
	
	It is assumed that the pair $y_{Aij}$ and $y_{Bij}$ follow a bivariate normal distribution.
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			y_{Aij} \\
			y_{Bij} \\
		\end{array}
		\right) \sim \mathcal{N}(
		\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})\mbox{   where } \boldsymbol{\mu} = \left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			\mu_{A} \\
			\mu_{B} \\
		\end{array}
		\right)
	\end{eqnarray*}
	
	The matrix $\Sigma$ represents the variance component matrix between response variables at a given time point $j$.
	
	\[
	\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
	\sigma^2_{A} & \sigma_{AB} \\
	\sigma_{AB} & \sigma^2_{B}\\
	\end{array}   \right)
	\]
	
	$\sigma^2_{A}$ is the variance of variable $A$, $\sigma^2_{B}$ is the variance of variable $B$ and $\sigma_{AB}$ is the covariance of the two variable. It is assumed that $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ does not depend on a particular time point, and is the same over all time points.

	\section{The Technology Acceptance Model}
	Davis (1989) proposes the TAM model, which suggests an hypothesis as to why users may adopt particular technologies, and not others. 
	According to this theory, when users are presented with a new 
	technology, two important factors will influence their decision about how and when they will adopt it.
	\begin{description}
		\item[Perceived usefulness (PU)] - This was defined by Fred Davis as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance".
		\item[Perceived ease-of-use (PEOU)] - Davis defined this as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort" 
	\end{description}
	
	Davis's explanations of these term can be rephrased for application to statistical analysis. 
	Perceived Use could refer to the degree to which an user would deem a particular statistical method would properly establish the results of an analaysis. In the case of method comparison studies, proper indication of agreement, or lack thereof.
	
	
	Perceived ease-of-use requires only applying the context of a satistical problem. A very modest statistical skill set is the only prerequistive for constructing a Bland-Altman plot, and computing limits of agreement. The main building blocks 
	are simple descriptive, statistics and a knowledge of the normal distribution. These are topics that feature in almost every undergraduate statistics courses. Furthermore \citet{kikozak2014including} recommends including the Bland-Altman method itself in undergraduate teaching.
	%---------------------------------------------%
	
	In short, the user perceives the Bland-Altman methodology to be an easy-to-implement technique, that will properly address the question of agreement.
	
	Conversely the Survival plot is a derivative of the Kaplan-Meier Curve, a non-parametric graphical technique that features in Survival Analysis. This subject area is a well known domain of statistics, but would be encountered 
	on curriculums of specialist courses. 
	
	The Mountain Plot is formally called the empirical folder cumulative distribution plot. While not particularly hard to render, the procedure is not straight-forward for the casual user. Currently there is only one software implementation, \textbf{\textit{medcalc.be}} toolkit.

		%\section{Agreement Indices}
		%\citet{Barnhart} provided an overview of several agreement
		%indices, including the limits of agreement. Other approaches, such
		%as mean squared deviation, the tolerance deviation index and
		%coverage probability are also discussed.
	\section{Lin's Reproducibility Index} Lin proposes the use of a
	reproducibility index, called the Concordance Correlation
	Coefficent (CCC).While it is not strictly a measure of agreement
	as such, it can form part of an overall method comparision
	methodology.
