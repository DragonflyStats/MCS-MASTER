Saddle is a high-performance data manipulation library for Scala.

Saddle provides array-backed, indexed, one- and two-dimensional data structures; vectorized numerical calculations; automatic data alignment; and robustness to missing values.

Saddle is the easiest and most expressive way to program with structured data on the JVM.

Introduction
Saddle is a data manipulation library for Scala that provides array-backed, indexed, one- and two-dimensional data structures that are judiciously specialized on JVM primitives to avoid the overhead of boxing and unboxing.

Saddle offers vectorized numerical calculations, automatic alignment of data along indices, robustness to missing (N/A) values, and facilities for I/O.

Saddle draws inspiration from several sources, among them the R programming language & statistical environment, the numpy and pandas Python libraries, and the Scala collections library.
