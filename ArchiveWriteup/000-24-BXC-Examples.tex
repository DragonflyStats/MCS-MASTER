\section{Limits of agreement for Carstensen's data}


\citet{bxc2008} describes the calculation of the limits of agreement (with the inter-method bias implicit) for both data sets, based on his formulation;

\[\hat{\alpha}_1 - \hat{\alpha}_2 \pm 2\sqrt{2\hat{\tau}^2 +\hat{\sigma}_1^2 +\hat{\sigma}_2^2 }.\]

For the `Fat' data set, the inter-method bias is shown to be $0.045$. The limits of agreement are $(-0.23 , 0.32)$

Carstensen demonstrates the use of the interaction term when computing the limits of agreement for the `Oximetry' data set. When the interaction term is omitted, the limits of agreement are $(-9.97, 14.81)$. Carstensen advises the inclusion of the interaction term for linked replicates, and hence the limits of agreement are recomputed as $(-12.18,17.12)$.
