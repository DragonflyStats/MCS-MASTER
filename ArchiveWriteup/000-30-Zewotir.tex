\section{Demidenko's I Influence} %2.6
The concept of I Influence is generalized  to the non linea regression model.


\subsection{Extension of techniques to LME Models} %1.2

Model diagnostic techniques, well established for classical models, have since been adapted for use with linear mixed effects models. Diagnostic techniques for LME models are inevitably more difficult to implement, due to the increased complexity.

\citet{Beckman} applied the \index{local influence}local influence method of Cook (1986) to the analysis of the linear mixed model.

While the concept of influence analysis is straightforward, implementation in mixed models is more complex. Update formulae for fixed effects models are available only when the covariance parameters are assumed to be known.

If the global measure suggests that the points in $U$ are influential, the nature of that influence should be determined. In particular, the points in $U$ can affect the following

\begin{itemize}
	\item the estimates of fixed effects,
	\item the estimates of the precision of the fixed effects,
	\item the estimates of the covariance parameters,
	\item the estimates of the precision of the covariance parameters,
	\item fitted and predicted values.
\end{itemize}








%--------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{Residual Analysis for Linear Models, LME models and GLMs}

\textbf{Keywords:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Residuals (\emph{Beginners}), 
	\item Testing the Assumption of Normality (\emph{Beginners})
	\item Diagnostic Plots with the \texttt{plot} function
	\item Cook's Distance
	\item DFFits and DFBeta
	\item Standardized and Studentized Residuals
	\item Influence Leverage and Outlierness
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Diagnostics for Random Effects}
Empirical best linear unbiased predictors EBLUPS provide the a useful way of diagnosing random effects.

EBLUPs are also known as ``shrinkage estimators" because they tend to be smaller than the estimated effects would be if they were computed by treating a random factor as if it was fixed (West et al )







\subsection{Case Deletion Diagnostics for Mixed Models}

\citet{Christensen} notes the case deletion diagnostics techniques have not been applied to linear mixed effects models and seeks to develop methodologies in that respect.

\citet{Christensen} develops these techniques in the context of REML

\subsection{Methods and Measures}
The key to making deletion diagnostics useable is the development of efficient computational formulas, allowing one to obtain the \index{case deletion diagnostics} case deletion diagnostics by making use of basic building blocks, computed only once for the full model.


\section{Tewomir - Measures of Influence in LME Models}%2.2
%Zewotir page 161
\citet{tewomir} describes a number of approaches to model diagnostics, investigating each of the following;
\begin{itemize}
	\item Variance components
	\item Fixed effects parameters
	\item Prediction of the response variable and of random effects
	\item likelihood function
\end{itemize}

\citet{tewomir} lists several established methods of analyzing influence in LME models. These methods include \begin{itemize}
	\item Cook's distance for LME models,
	\item \index{likelihood distance} likelihood distance,
	\item the variance (information) ration,
	\item the \index{Cook-Weisberg statistic} Cook-Weisberg statistic,
	\item the \index{Andrews-Prebigon statistic} Andrews-Prebigon statistic.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Taxonomy of Cook's Distances for LMEs}
\citet{tewomir} discusses a taxonomy of Cook's distance when applied to LME models. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item For variance components $\gamma$: $CD(\gamma)_i$,
	\item For fixed effect parameters $\beta$: $CD(\beta)_i$,
	\item For random effect parameters $\boldsymbol{u}$: $CD(u)_i$,
	\item For linear functions of $\hat{beta}$: $CD(\psi)_i$
\end{itemize}			


%A large value for $CD(u)_i$ indicates that the $i-$th observation is influential in predicting random effects.

	Abstract: Linear mixed models are extremely sensitive to outlying responses and extreme points in the fixed and random effect design spaces. Few diagnostics are available in standard computing packages. We provide routine diagnostic tools, which are computationally inexpensive. The diagnostics
	are functions of basic building blocks: studentized residuals, error contrast matrix, and the inverse of the response variable covariance matrix. The basic building blocks are computed only once from the complete data analysis and provide information on the influence of the data on different aspects
	of the model fit. Numerical examples provide analysts with the complete pictures of the diagnostics.

with $\boldsymbol{V}$ unknown, a standard practice for estimating $\boldsymbol{X \beta}$ is the estime the variance components $\sigma^2_j$,
compute an estimate for $\boldsymbol{V}$ and then compute the projector matrix $A$, $\boldsymbol{X \hat{\beta}}  = \boldsymbol{AY}$.

A large number of statistics have been proposed to study the influence of individual 
observations in the linear mixed model. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is used 
to evaluate the appropriateness of these influence diagnostic measures. The sensitivity of 
the diagnostic measures to outliers and leverages is examined, and helpful results are 
obtained.

	We consider a generalized leverage matrix useful for the identification of influential units and observations in linear mixed models and show how a decomposition of this matrix may be employed to identify high leverage points for both the marginal fitted values and the random effect component of the conditional fitted values. We illustrate the different uses of the two components of the decomposition with a simulated example as well as with a real data set.\citet{nobresinger}

In this paper, we consider subset deletion diagnostics for fixed effects (coefficient functions), 
random effects and one variance component in varying coefficient mixed models (VCMMs). 
Some simple updated formulas are obtained, and based on which, Cook's distance, joint 
influence and conditional influence are also investigated. Besides, since mean shift outlier 
models (MSOMs) are also efficient to detect outliers, we establish an equivalence ..............
