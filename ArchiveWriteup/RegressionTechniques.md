Regression Approaches to MCS
============================================
- This section of the paper will discuss several regression-based techniques for method comparison study, 
such as *Deming Regression*. 
- This section will highlight several useful characteristics of the data that 
regression based techniques may highlight, and also the limitations of these techniques.

### Deming Regression
Whereas the OLS method assumes that only the Y measurements are associated with 
random measurement errors, the Deming method takes measurement errors for both methods of measurement into account.
