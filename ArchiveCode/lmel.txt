Linear Mixed Effects models
Models where both fixed effects and Random effects occur linearly in the model function
described by Laird and Ware 1982

Beta is a p dimension vector of fixed effects
Z X Regressor matrices for both fixed effects and random effects
the B matrix is defined to have a mean 0 
relative precision factor (@DEL) expresses the variance covariance matrix
The Precision matrix (@phi^-1)
(@sigma(error))

Single Level or Multilevel


profiled log likeihood is maximized with respect to @Theta, producing the maximum likelihood estimate @theta_hat
profiled log likeihod consists of three additive components -  
a constant
a scaled logarithm of the RSS and 
a sum of theratios of the logarithms of the determinants

Restricted likelihood estimation (REML)

several ways to compute the estimation criterion.

optimization algorithms
-through EM iterations
-through Newton Raphon Algorithms
EM used for incomplete data


Each NR iteration requires a caclualton of the score function and its derivativethe hessian matrix
of the log likelihood

The NR algorithm converges quadratically under general conditions
