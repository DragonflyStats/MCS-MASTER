p-values of LR tests on variance components

The likelihood ratio is a reasonable criterion for comparing
these two models. However, the theory behind using a 
$ \chi^2$
distribution with 1 degree of freedom as a reference
distribution for this test statistic does not apply in this case.
The null hypothesis is on the boundary of region of the
parameter space.

Even at the best of times, the p-values for such tests are only
approximate because they are based on the asymptotic
behavior of the test statistic. To carry the argument further,
all results in statistics are based on models and, as George
Box famously said, “All models are wrong; some models are
useful.”


In this case the problem with the boundary condition results
in a p-value that is larger than it would be if, say, you
compared this likelihood ratio to values obtained for data
simulated from the null hypothesis model. We say these
results are “conservative”.

As a rule of thumb, the p-value for a simple, scalar term is
roughly twice as large as it should be.

In this case, dividing the p-value in half would not aﬀect our
conclusion.
