air extra random effect that does not depend on method.
It is treated as an extension of i.
The variance of air represents the variation between replication condition (common for all methods), within items, .

ymir=m+i+cmi+emir

cmi=N(0,m2)

emir=N(0,m2)

Section 7 A general model for method comparisons.

Carstensen discusses the model and its use as if all parameter estimates are available.

In this model, intermethod bias is assumed to be constant at all measurement levels.

i : True value for item i

The parameter i can be thought of as the underlying, but unobtainable, true measurement for item i.

m: Fixed effect for method m
