3. Non-constant difference
3.1. Model
If it is observed that the assumption of constant difference between methods is violated, i.e. if there is clear slope in the
Blandâ€“Altman plot, the differences can be regressed on the averages (or sums) and the results used to construct prediction
intervals of the difference between two future measurements.
