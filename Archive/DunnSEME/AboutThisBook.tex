This is a practically oriented introduction to the realiability of measurements. One of the implicit themes is that the measurement models and the statistical methods used in the assessment of accuracy are common to virtually all fields of scientific endeavor. For this latest edition, Dunn has integrated the design and analysis of this type of study to make it easier and included new data sets and examples. Also, he has included the hot new topics of Monte Carlo simulations and the bootstrap, making this an essential guide for all students and scholars of applied statistics.
