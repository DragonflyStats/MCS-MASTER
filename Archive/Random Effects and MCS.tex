\section{Random Effects and MCS}
The methodology comprises two calculations. The second calculation
is for the standard deviation of means Before the modified Bland
and Altman method can be applied for repeated measurement data, a
check of the assumption that the variance of the repeated
measurements for each subject by each method is independent of the
mean of the repeated measures. This can be done by plotting the
within-subject standard deviation against the mean of each subject
by each method. Mean Square deviation measures the total deviation
of a

	\title{Roy's Candidate models}
	The original Bland Altman Method was developed for two sets of
	measurements done on one occasion (i.e. independent data), and so
	this approach is not suitable for repeated measures data. However,
	as a naïve analysis, it may be used to explore the data because of
	the simplicity of the method. Myles states that such misuse of the
	standards Bland Altman method is widespread in Anaesthetic and
	critical care literature.
	\\
	\\
	Bland and Altman have provided a modification for analysing
	repeated measures under stable or chaninging conditions, where
	repeated data is collected over a period of time. Myers proposes
	an alternative Random effects model for this purpose.
	\\
	\\
	with repeated measures data, we can
	calculate the mean of the repeated measurements by each method on
	each individuals. \emph{ The pairs of means can then be used to
		compare the two methods based on the 95\% limits of agreement for
		the difference of means. The bias between the two methods will not
		be affected by averaging the repeated measurements.}.However the
	variation of the differences will be underestimated by this
	practice because the measurement error is, to some extent,
	removed. Some advanced statistical calculations are needed to take
	into account these measurement errors. \emph{Random effects models
		can be used to estimate the within-subject variation after
		accounting for other observed and unobserved variations, in which
		each subject has a different intercept and slope over the
		observation period .On the basis of the within-subject variance
		estimated by the random effects model, we can then create an
		appropriate Bland Altman Plot.}The sequence or the time of the
	measurement over the observation period can be taken as a random
	effect.
	\section{Random effects Model} \citet{Myles} proposes the use of
	Random effects models to address the issue of repeated
	measurement. Myles proposes a formulation of the BlandAltman
	plot, using the within-subject variance estimated by the random
	effects model, with the time of the measurement taken as a random
	effect. He states that \emph{random effects models account for the
		dependent nature of the data, and additional explanatory
		variables, to provide reliable estimates of agreement in this
		setting.}
	\\
	Agreement between methods is reflected by the between-subject
	variation.The Random Effects Model takes this into account before
	calculating the within-subject standard deviation.
	\subsection{Myers Random Effects Model} The presentation of the
	95\% limits of agreement is for visual judgement of how well two
	methods of measurement agree. The smaller the range between the
	two, the better the agreement is The question of small is small is
	a question of clinical judgement
	\\
	\\
	Repeated measurements for each subjects are often used in clinical
	research.
	
	\subsection{Random Effects Modelling}
	Random effects models are used to examine the within-subject
	variation after adjusting for known and unknown variables, in
	which each subject has a different intercept and slope over a time
	period period.
	\\
	\\
	\citet{Myles} remarks that the random effects model is an
	extension of the analysis of variance method, accounting for more
	covariates.
	\\
	\\
	A random effect (in Myles's case, time of measurement) is chosen
	to reflect the different intercept and slope for each subject with
	respect to their change of measurements over the time period.
	\\
	\\
	In Myles's methodology, the standard deviation of difference
	between the means of the repeated measurements can be calculated
	based on the within-subject standard deviation estimates.
	
	A random effects model (also variance components model)is a type
	of hierarchical linear model. Hierarchical linear modelling (HLM)
	is a more advanced form of simple linear regression and multiple
	linear regression. HLM is appropriate for use with nested
	data.\\Faraway comments that the random effects approach is
	\emph{more ambitious than the LME model in that it attempts to say
		something about the wider population beyond the particular
		sample}.

\subsection{Marginal Modelling}
(Diggle 2002) proposes the use of marginal models as an
alternative to mixed models.m Marginal models are appropriate when
interences about the mean response are of specific interest.
\section{KP}
Most residual covariance structures are design for one
within-subject factor. However two or more may be present. For
such cases,an approppriate approach would be the residual
covariance structure using Kronecker product of the underlying
within-subject factor specific covariances structure.
