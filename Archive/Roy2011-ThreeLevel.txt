#### Abstract 
- This article considers an approach to estimating and testing a new Kronecker product covariance structure 
for three-level (multiple time points (p), multiple sites (u), and multiple response variables (q)) multivariate data. 
- Testing of such covariance structure is potentially important for high dimensional multi-level multivariate data. 
- The hypothesis testing procedure developed in this article can not only test the hypothesis for three-level multivariate
data, but also can test many different hypotheses, such as blocked compound symmetry, for two-level multivariate data 
as special cases. 
- The tests are implemented with two real data sets.
