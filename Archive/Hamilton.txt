Abstract

This work discusses how a prediction interval can be used to eatimate whether a future difference between two devices will be 
within acceptable limits with reasonable confidence.

%-------------------------------%
Single Measurement Case


The prediction error for the future
$\tilde{d}$

$\operatorname{var}(\tilde{d} -  \bar{d}) = \sigma^2(1 + 1/n)$

The true variance $\sigma^2$ is unknown.

\[\bar{d} \pm t_{(n-1, 1-\alpha/2)} s \sqrt{(1 + 1/n)}\]
