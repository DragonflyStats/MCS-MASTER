Such influential observations can completely distort an analysis and lead to inappropriate actions and conclusions. We develop case-deletion diagnostics for detecting influential observations in mixed linear models. Diagnostics for both fixed effects and variance components are proposed. Computational formulas are given that make the procedures feasible. The methods are illustrated using examples.},
