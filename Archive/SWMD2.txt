The cut off value or threshold which divides anomalous and non-anomalous 
data numerically is often the basis for important decisions.

The Basis for multivariate outlier detection is the mahalanobis distance.
The Standard method foroutlier detection is robust estimation of the parameters 
in the mahalanobis distance and the comparison with a critical values of the Chi Square
Distribution ( Rousseeuw and Van Zomeren 1990).
