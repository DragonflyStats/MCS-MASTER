	\section{Bland-Altman methodology}

%		\citet{BA83} highlighted the inadequacies of these approaches for comparing two methods of measurement, and proposed methodologies with this specific application in mind. Although the authors also acknowledge the opportunity to apply other, more complex, approaches, but argue that simpler approaches is preferable, especially when the
%		results must be `explained to non-statisticians'.
		
		The issue of whether two measurement methods comparable to the 	extent that they can be used interchangeably with sufficient accuracy is encountered frequently in scientific research.
	Statisticians Martin Bland and Douglas Altman recognized the inadequacies of these analyzes and
	articulated quite thoroughly the basis on which of which they are unsuitable for comparing two methods of measurement \citep*{BA83}. In 1986 Bland and Altman published a paper in the Lancet proposing the difference plot for use for method comparison purposes. Bland Altman have recommended the use of graphical techniques to assess agreement. Principally their method is calculating, for each pair of corresponding two methods of measurement of some
	underlying quantity, with no replicate measurements, the
	difference and average. Differences are then plotted against the
	average. This plot has proved highly popular ever since. This is a simple, and widely used , plot of the differences of each data pair, and the corresponding average value. An important requirement is that the	two measurement methods use the same scale of measurement.
		
	Furthermore they proposed their simple methodology specifically constructed for method comparison studies. They acknowledge the opportunity to apply other valid, but complex, methodologies, but argue that a simple approach is preferable, especially when the results must be `explained to non-statisticians'.
	
	\section{Bland-Altman Plots}
	
	In light of shortcomings associated with scatterplots,
	\citet*{BA83} recommend a further analysis of the data. Firstly
	case-wise differences of measurements of two methods $d_{i} =
	y_{1i}-y_{2i}, \mbox{ for }i=1,2,\dots,n$, on the same subject
	should be calculated, and then the average of those measurements, 
	($a_{i} = (y_{1i} + y_{2i})/2 \mbox{ for }i=1,2,\dots, n$.
	
	Following a technique known as the Tukey mean-difference plot, as noted by \citet{kozak2014including}
	\citet{BA83} proposed that $a_i$ should be plotted against $d_i$, a plot now widely known as the Bland-Altman plot, and motivated this plot as follows:
	\begin{quote}
		``From this type of plot it is much easier to assess the magnitude
		of disagreement (both error and bias), spot outliers, and see
		whether there is any trend, for example an increase in (difference) for high values. This way of plotting the data is a very powerful way of displaying the results of a method comparison study."
	\end{quote}
	
The case wise-averages capture several aspects of the data, such as expressing the range over which the values were taken, and assessing whether the assumptions of constant variance holds. Case-wise averages also allow the case-wise differences to be presented on a two-dimensional plot, with better data visualization qualities than a one dimensional plot. \citet{BA86}
	cautions that it would be the difference against either measurement value instead of their average, as the difference relates to both value. This approach has proved very popular, and the Bland-Altman plots is widely regarded as powerful graphical tool for making a visual assessment of the data.
	
The magnitude of the inter-method bias between the two methods is simply the average of the differences $\bar{d}$. This inter-method bias is represented with a line on the Bland-Altman plot. As the objective of the Bland-Altman plot is to advise on the agreement of two methods, the individual case-wise differences are also particularly relevant. The variances around this bias is estimated by the standard deviation of these differences $S_{d}$.
	
Notwithstanding previous remarks about linear regression, the first step recommended, which the authors argue should be mandatory, is construction of a simple scatter plot of the data. The line of equality should also be shown, as it is necessary to give the correct interpretation of how both methods compare. In the case of good agreement, the observations would be distributed closely along the line of equality. In the case of good agreement, the observations would be distributed closely along this line. However, they are not useful for a thorough examination of the data. \citet{BritHypSoc} notes that data points will tend to cluster around the line of equality, obscuring interpretation. A scatter plot of the Grubbs data is shown in Figure 1.1. Visual inspection confirms the previous conclusion that inter-method bias is present, i.e. the Fotobalk device has a tendency to record a lower velocity.

%	\section*{Rendering a Bland-Altma plot}
%	Construction of a Bland-Altman plot can be implemented easily with \texttt{R} packages such as Bendix Carstensen's \texttt{MethComp} package, which is designed to \textit{provide computational tools to manipulate, display and analyze data from method comparison studies} \citep{BXC2010}.
%	
\subsection{Bland-Altman plots for the Grubbs data}
In the case of the Grubbs data the inter-method bias is $-0.61$ metres per second, and is indicated by the dashed line on Figure 1.2. By inspection of the plot, it is also possible to compare the precision of each method. Noticeably the differences tend to increase as the averages increase.
	
The Bland-Altman plot for comparing the `Fotobalk' and `Counter' methods, which shall henceforth be referred to as the `F vs C' comparison,  is depicted in Figure 1.2, using data from Table 1.3.
The presence and magnitude of the inter-method bias is indicated by the dashed line.

	%Later it will be shown that case-wise differences are the sole
	%component of the next part of the methodology, the limits of
	%agreement.

	,simple linear regression may yield results of interest.
	
	\section{Inspecting the Data}
	Bland-Altman plots are a powerful graphical methodology for making
	a visual assessment of the data. \citet*{BA83} express the
	motivation for this plot thusly:
	\begin{quote}
		"From this type of plot it is much easier to assess the magnitude
		of disagreement (both error and bias), spot outliers, and see
		whether there is any trend, for example an increase in
		(difference) for high values. This way of plotting the data is a
		very powerful way of displaying the results of a method comparison
		study."
	\end{quote}
	
	
	Figures 1.3 1.4 and 1.5 are three Bland-Altman plots derived from
	simulated data, each for the purpose of demonstrating how the plot
	would inform an analyst of trends that would adversely affect use
	of the recommended methodology. Figure 1.3 demonstrates how the
	Bland Altman plot would indicate increasing variance of
	differences over the measurement range. Figure 1.4 is an example
	of cases where the inter-method bias changes over the measurement
	range. This is known as proportional bias \citep{ludbrook97}.

	\newpage
	Figure 1.4 is an example of cases where the inter-method bias
	changes over the measurement range. This is known as proportional
	bias (Ludbrook, 1997). Both of these cases violate the assumptions
	necessary for further analysis using limits of agreement ,which
	shall be discussed later. The plot also can be used to identify
	outliers. An outlier is an observation that is numerically distant
	from the rest of the data. Classification thereof is a subjective
	decision in any analysis, but must be informed by the logic of the
	formulation. Figure 1.5 is a Bland Altman plot with two
	conspicuous observations, at the extreme left and right of the
	plot respectively.
	
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=125mm]{images/BAOutliers.jpeg}
			\caption{Bland-Altman Plot indicating the presence of Outliers}\label{PropBias}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}
	
	In the Bland-Altman plot, the horizontal displacement of any
	observation is supported by two independent measurements. Hence
	any observation , such as the one on the extreme right of figure
	1.5, should not be considered an outlier on the basis of a
	noticeable horizontal displacement from the main cluster. The one
	on the extreme left should be considered an outlier, as it has a
	noticeable vertical displacement from the rest of the
	observations.
	
	\citet*{BA99} do not recommend excluding outliers from analyses.
	However recalculation of the inter-method bias estimate , and
	further calculations based upon that estimate, are useful for
	assessing the influence of outliers.\citep{BA99} states that
	\emph{"We usually find that this method of analysis is not too
		sensitive to one or two large outlying differences."}




	\section{Bland Altman Plots}
	The issue of whether two measurement methods comparable to the
	extent that they can be used interchangeably with sufficient
	accuracy is encountered frequently in scientific research.
	Historically comparison of two methods of measurement was carried
	out by use of correlation coefficients or simple linear
	regression. Bland and Altman recognized the inadequacies of these
	analyses and articulated quite thoroughly the basis on which of
	which they are unsuitable for comparing two methods of measurement
	\citep*{BA83}.
	
	
	Furthermore they proposed their simple methodology specifically
	constructed for method comparison studies. They acknowledge that
	there are other valid, but complex, methodologies, and argue that
	a simple approach is preferable to this complex approaches,
	\emph{especially when the results must be explained to
		non-statisticians} \citep*{BA83}.
	
	\smallskip
	
	Notwithstanding previous remarks about regression, the first step
	recommended ,which the authors argue should be mandatory,is
	construction of a simple scatter plot of the data. The line of
	equality ($X=Y$) should also be shown, as it is necessary to give
	the correct interpretation of how both methods compare. A scatter
	plot of the Grubbs data is shown in figure 2.1. A visual
	inspection thereof confirms the previous conclusion that there is
	an inter method bias present, i.e. Fotobalk device has a tendency
	to record a lower velocity.

			\includegraphics[width=130mm]{images/GrubbsScatter.jpeg}
			\caption{Scatter plot For Fotobalk and Counter Methods}\label{GrubbsScatter}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}
	
	In light of shortcomings associated with scatterplots,
	\citet*{BA83} recommend a further analysis of the data. Firstly
	differences of measurements of two methods on the same subject
	should  be calculated, and then the average of those measurements
	(Table 2.1). These differences and averages are then plotted
	(Figure 2.2).
	
	
	
	
	The dashed line in Figure 2.2 alludes to the inter method bias
	between the two methods, as mentioned previously. Bland and Altman
	recommend the estimation of inter method bias by calculating the
	average of the differences. In the case of Grubbs data the inter
	method bias is $-0.6083$ metres per second.

	\section{Limits of Agreement}
	% introduces
	A third element of the Bland-Altman approach, an interval known
	as `limits of agreement' is introduced in \citet*{BA86}
	(sometimes referred to in literature as 95\% limits of agreement).
	Limits of agreement are used to assess whether the two methods of
	measurement can be used interchangeably. \citet{BA86} refer to
	this as the `equivalence' of two measurement methods. The specific question to which limits of
	agreement are intended as the answer to must be
	established clearly. \citet*{BA95} comment that the limits of agreement show `how
	far apart measurements by the two methods were likely to be for
	most individuals', a definition echoed in their 1999 paper:
	
	\begin{quote}``We can then say that nearly all pairs
		of measurements by the two methods will be closer together than
		these extreme values, which we call 95\% limits of agreement.
		These values define the range within which most differences

	\end{quote}
	
	The limits of agreement (LoA) are computed by the following
	formula:
	\[
	LoA = \bar{d} \pm 1.96 s_{d}
	\]
	with $\bar{d}$ as the estimate of the inter method bias, $s_{d}$
	as the standard deviation of the differences and 1.96 (sometimes rounded to 2) is the 95\%
	quantile for the standard normal distribution. The limits of agreement methodology assumes a constant level of bias throughout the range of measurements. Importantly the authors recommend prior determination of what would constitute acceptable
	agreement, and that sample sizes should be predetermined to give an accurate conclusion. However \citet{mantha} highlight inadequacies in the correct application of limits of agreement, resulting in contradictory estimates of limits of agreement in various papers.

	%will be a question of judgment. Ideally, it should be defined in
	%advance to help in the interpretation of the method comparison and
	%to choose the sample size \citep{BA86}".
	%\end{quote}
	
	
	For the Grubbs `F vs C' comparison, these limits
	of agreement are calculated as -0.132 for the upper bound, and
	-1.08 for the lower bound. Figure 1.9 shows the resultant
	Bland-Altman plot, with the limits of agreement shown in dashed

%	\section{Limits of Agreement}
%	\citet{BA86} introduces an elaboration of the plot, adding to the
%	plot `limits of agreement' to the plot. These limits are based
%	upon the standard deviation of the differences. The discussion
%	shall be reverted to these limits of agreement in due course.

	\section{Limits Of Agreement}
	Bland and Altman proposed a pair of Limits of agreement, not unlike control limits in control charts. These
	limits are intended to demonstrate the range in which 95\% of the sample data should lie. The Limits of Agreement centre on the
	average difference line and are 1.96 times the standard deviation above and below the average difference line.
	
	How this relates the overall population is unclear. It seems that it depends on an expert to decide whether or not the range of
	differences is acceptable. In a study A Bland-Altman plots compare two assay methods. It plots the difference between the two
	measurements on the Y axis, and the average of the two measurements on the X axis.
	
%	The bias is computed as the average of the difference of paired assays.
	
	If one method is sometimes higher, and sometimes the other method is higher, the average of the differences will be close to zero.
	If it is not close to zero, this indicates that the two assay methods are producing different results systematically.



	\subsection{Formal definition of limits of agreement}
	\citet{BA99} note the similarity of limits of agreement to confidence intervals, but are clear that they are not the same
	thing. Interestingly, they simply describe the limits as `being like a reference interval', offering no elaboration.
	
	Limits of agreement have very similar construction to Shewhart control limits. The Shewhart chart is a well known graphical
	methodology used in statistical process control. Consequently there is potential for misinterpreting the limits of agreement as
	they were Shewhart control limits. Importantly the parameters used to determine the Shewhart limits are time ordered, based on the process's historical values, a key difference with Bland-Altman limits of agreement.
	
	\citet{BXC2008} regards the limits of agreement as a prediction
	interval for the difference between future measurements with the
	two methods on a new individual, but states that it does not fit
	the formal definition of a prediction interval, since the
	definition does not consider the errors in estimation of the
	parameters. Prediction intervals, which are often used in
	regression analysis, are estimates of an interval in which future
	observations will fall, with a certain probability, given what has
	already been observed. \citet{BXC2008} offers an alternative
	formulation, a $95\%$ prediction interval for the difference
	\[
	\bar{d} \pm t_{(0.025, n-1)}s_{d} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}
	\]
	
	\noindent where $n$ is the number of subjects. Carstensen is
	careful to consider the effect of the sample size on the interval
	width, adding that only for 61 or more subjects is the
	quantile less than 2.
	
	\citet{luiz} offers an alternative description of limits of agreement, this time as tolerance limits. A tolerance interval for
	a measured quantity is the interval in which a specified fraction of the population's values lie, with a specified level of
	confidence. \citet{Barnhart} describes them as a probability interval, and offers a clear description of how they should be
	used; `if the absolute limit is less than an acceptable difference $d_{0}$, then the agreement between the two methods is deemed
	satisfactory'.
	
	The prevalence of contradictory definitions of what limits of agreement strictly are will inevitably attenuate the poor standard of reporting using limits of agreement, as mentioned by \citet{mantha}.
	
	%At least 100 historical
	%values must be used to determine the acceptable value (i.e the
	%process mean) and the process standard deviation. The principle
	%that the mean and variance of a large sample of a homogeneous
	%population is a close approximation of the population's mean and
	%variance justifies this.

	%  \caption{Limits of agreement with confidence intervals}\label{LOAwCIs}
	%\end{center}
	%\end{figure}
	
	%\newpage
	%\section{Agreement Indices}
	%\citet{Barnhart} provided an overview of several agreement
	%indices, including the limits of agreement. Other approaches, such
	%as mean squared deviation, the tolerance deviation index and
	%coverage probability are also discussed.
	


	\section{Appropriate Use of Limits of Agreement}
	Importantly \citet{BA99} makes the following point:
	\begin{quote}These estimates are meaningful only if we can assume
		bias and variability are uniform throughout the range of
		measurement, assumptions which can be checked graphically.
	\end{quote}
	
	The import of this statement is that , should the Bland Altman
	plot indicate that these assumptions are not met, then their
	entire methodology, as posited thus far, is inappropriate for use
	in a method comparison study. Again, in the context of potential
	outlier in the Grubbs data (figure 1.2), this raises the question
	on how to correctly continue.
	
	Carstensen attends to the issue of repeated data, using the
	expression replicate to express a repeated measurement on a
	subject by the same methods. Carstensen formulates the data as
	follows Repeated measurement - Arrangement of data into groups,
	based on the series of results of each subject.
	
	
	
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%

	\section{Precision of Limits of Agreement}
	The limits of agreement are estimates derived from the sample
	studied, and will differ from values relevant to the whole
	population. A different sample would give different limits of
	agreement. \citet*{BA86} advance a formulation for confidence
	intervals of the inter-method bias and the limits of agreement.
	These calculations employ quantiles of the `t' distribution with
	$n -1$ degrees of freedom.
	
	%This page also shows the standard deviation (SD) of the
	%differences between the two assay methods. The SD value is used to
	%calculate the limits of agreement, computed as the mean bias plus
	%or minus 1.96 times its SD.
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	
	
	\section{Inferences on Bland-Altman estimates}
	\citet*{BA99} advises on how to calculate confidence intervals for the inter-method bias and limits of agreement.
	For the inter-method bias, the confidence interval is a simply that of a mean: $\bar{d} \pm t_{(\alpha/2,n-1)} S_{d}/\sqrt{n}$.
	The confidence
	intervals and standard error for the limits of agreement follow from the variance of the limits of agreement, which is shown to be
	
	\[
	\mbox{Var}(LoA) = (\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1.96^{2}}{2(n-1)})s_{d}^{2}.
	\]
	
	If $n$ is sufficiently large this can be following approximation
	can be used
	\[
	\mbox{Var}(LoA) \approx 1.71^{2}\frac{s_{d}^{2}}{n}.
	\]
	Consequently the standard errors of both limits can be
	approximated as $1.71$ times the standard error of the
	differences.
	
	A $95\%$ confidence interval can be determined, by means of the
	\emph{t} distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom. However, \citet*{BA99} comment that such calculations  may be `somewhat optimistic' on account of the associated assumptions not being realized.
	
	%\section{Small Sample Sizes} The limits of agreement are
	%estimates derived from the sample studied, and will differ from
	%values relevant to the whole population, hence the importance of a
	%suitably large sample size. A different sample would give
	%different limits of agreement. Student's t-distribution is a well
	%known probability distribution used in statistical inference for
	%normally distributed populations when the sample size is small
	%\citep{student,Fisher3}. Consequently, using 't' quantiles , as
	%opposed to standard normal quantiles, may give a more appropriate
	%calculation for limits of agreement when the sample size is small.
	%For sample size $n=12$ the `t' quantile is 2.2 and the limits of
	%agreement are (-0.074,-1.143).
	
	


	\section{Adverse features}
	
	Estimates for inter-method bias and variance of differences are only meaningful if there is uniform inter-bias and variability throughout the range of measurements. Fulfilment of these assumptions can be checked by visual inspection of the plot.The prototype Bland-Altman plots depicted in Figures 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 are derived from simulated data, for the purpose of demonstrating how the plot would inform an analyst of features that would adversely affect use of the recommended approach.
	
	Figure 1.4 demonstrates how the Bland-Altman plot would indicate
	increasing variance of differences over the measurement range.
	Fitted regression lines, for both the upper and lower half of the
	plot, has been added to indicate the trend. Figure 1.5 is an example of cases where the inter-method bias changes over the
	measurement range. This is known as proportional bias, and is defined by \citet{ludbrook97} as meaning that `one method gives
	values that are higher (or lower) than those from the other by an
	amount that is proportional to the level of the measured variable'. In both Figures 1.4 and 1.5, the assumptions necessary
	for further analysis using the limits of agreement are violated.
	
	Application of regression techniques to the Bland-Altman plot, and
	subsequent formal testing for the constant variability of
	differences is informative. The data set may be divided into two
	subsets, containing the observations wherein the difference values
	are less than and greater than the inter-method bias respectively.
	For both of these fits, hypothesis tests for the respective slopes
	can be performed. While both tests could be considered separately,
	multiple comparison procedures, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg
	\citep{BH} test, are advisable.

	\end{figure}
	
	\newpage
	
	
	The Bland-Altman plot also can be used to identify outliers. An
	outlier is an observation that is conspicuously different from the
	rest of the data that it arouses suspicion that it occurs due to a
	mechanism, or conditions, different to that of the rest of the
	observations. \citet*{BA99} do not recommend excluding outliers from analyses,
	but remark that recalculation of the inter-method bias estimate,
	and further calculations based upon that estimate, are useful for
	assessing the influence of outliers. The authors remark that `we
	usually find that this method of analysis is not too sensitive to
	one or two large outlying differences'. Figure 1.6 demonstrates how the Bland-Altman
	plot can be used to visually inspect the presence of potential
	outliers.
	
	As a complement to the Bland-Altman plot, \citet{Bartko} proposes
	the use of a bivariate confidence ellipse, constructed for a
	predetermined level. \citet{AltmanEllipse} provides the relevant calculations for the
	ellipse. This ellipse is intended as a visual
	guidelines for the scatter plot, for detecting outliers and to
	assess the within- and between-subject variances.
	
	The minor axis relates to the between subject variability, whereas
	the major axis relates to the error mean square, with the ellipse
	depicting the size of both relative to each other.
	Consequently Bartko's ellipse provides a visual aid to determining the
	relationship between variances. If $\mbox{var}(a)$ is greater than $\mbox{var}(d)$, the orientation of the ellipse is horizontal. Conversely if $\mbox{var}(a)$ is less than $\mbox{var}(d)$, the orientation of the ellipse is vertical.
	
	
	%(Furthermore \citet{Bartko}
	%proposes formal testing procedures, that shall be discussed in due
	%course.)
	
	The Bland-Altman plot for the Grubbs data, complemented by Bartko's ellipse, is depicted in Figure 1.7.
	The fourth observation is shown to be outside the bounds of the ellipse, indicating that it is a potential outlier.

	\end{figure}
	
	The limitations of using bivariate approaches to outlier detection
	in the Bland-Altman plot can demonstrated using Bartko's ellipse.
	A covariate is added to the `F vs C' comparison that has a
	difference value equal to the inter-method bias, and an average
	value that markedly deviates from the rest of the average values
	in the comparison, i.e. 786. Table 1.8 depicts a $95\%$ confidence
	ellipse for this manipulated data set. By inspection of the
	confidence interval, we would conclude that this extra
	covariate is an outlier, in spite of the fact that this
	observation is very close to the inter-method bias as determined by this approach.

		\caption{Bartko's Ellipse for Grubbs' data, with an extra covariate.}\label{GrubbsBartko2}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	Importantly, outlier classification must be informed by the logic of the
	mechanism that produces the data. In the Bland-Altman plot, the horizontal displacement (i.e. the average) of any
	observation is supported by two separate measurements. Any
	observation should not be considered an outlier on the basis of a
	noticeable horizontal displacement from the main cluster, as in
	the case with the extra covariate. Conversely, the fourth
	observation, from the original data set, should be considered an
	outlier, as it has a noticeable vertical displacement from the
	rest of the observations.
	
	%Grubbs' test is a statistical test used for detecting outliers in a
	%univariate data set that is assumed to be normally distributed.
	
	%\citet{Grubbs} defined an outlier as a co-variate that appears to
	%deviate markedly from other members of the sample in which it
	%occurs.
	
	In classifying whether a observation from a univariate data set is
	an outlier, many formal tests are available, such as the Grubbs test for outliers. In assessing
	whether a covariate in a Bland-Altman plot is an outlier, this
	test is useful when applied to the case-wise difference values treated as a
	univariate data set. The null hypothesis of the Grubbs test procedure is the absence
	of any outliers in the data set. Conversely, the alternative hypotheses is that there is at least one outlier
	present.
	
	The test statistic for the Grubbs test ($G$) is the largest
	absolute deviation from the sample mean divided by the standard
	deviation of the differences,
	\begin{equation}
	G =  \displaystyle\max_{i=1,\ldots, n}\frac{\left \vert d_i -
		\bar{d}\right\vert}{S_{d}}.
	\end{equation}
	
	For the `F vs C' comparison it is the fourth observation gives
	rise to the test statistic, $G = 3.64$. The critical value is
	calculated using Student's $t$ distribution and the sample size,
	\[
	U = \frac{n-1}{\sqrt{n}} \sqrt{\frac{t_{\alpha/(2n),n-2}^2}{n - 2
			+ t_{\alpha/(2n),n-2}^2}}.
	\]
	For this test $U = 0.75$. The conclusion of this test is that the fourth observation in the `F vs C' comparison is an outlier, with $p-$value = 0.003, in accordance with the previous result of Bartko's ellipse.

	\section{Outliers}
	The Bland-Altman plot also can be used to identify outliers. An
	outlier is an observation that is conspicuously different from the
	rest of the data that it arouses suspicion that it occurs due to a
	mechanism, or conditions, different to that of the rest of the
	observations. \citet*{BA99} do not recommend excluding outliers from analyzes,
	but remark that recalculation of the inter-method bias estimate,
	and further calculations based upon that estimate, are useful for
	assessing the influence of outliers. The authors remark that `we
	usually find that this method of analysis is not too sensitive to
	one or two large outlying differences'. Figure 1.6 demonstrates how the Bland-Altman
	plot can be used to visually inspect the presence of potential
	outliers.

		\section{Bartko's Ellipse}
		
		As an enhancement on the Bland Altman Plot, \citet{Bartko} has
		expounded a confidence ellipse for the covariates. \citet{Bartko} proposes
		a bivariate confidence ellipse as a boundary for dispersion. The stated purpose is to `amplify dispersion', which presumably is for  the purposes of outlier detection. The orientation of the the ellipse is key to interpreting the results. The minor axis is related to the between-item variability whereas the major axis is related to the mean squared error (referred to here as Error Mean Square).The ellipse illustrates the size of both relative to each
		other. 
		
		
		Consequently Bartko's ellipse provides a visual aid to determining the
		relationship between variances. 
		Furthermore, the ellipse provides a visual aid to determining the relationship
		between the variance of the means $Var(a_{i})$ and the variance of the differences $Var(d_{i})$. If $\mbox{var}(a)$ is greater than $\mbox{var}(d)$, the orientation of the ellipse is horizontal. Conversely if $\mbox{var}(a)$ is less than $\mbox{var}(d)$, the orientation of the ellipse is vertical. The more horizontal the ellipse, the greater the degree of agreement between the two methods being tested.
		
		
		%(Furthermore \citet{Bartko}
		%proposes formal testing procedures, that shall be discussed in due
		%course.)
		Bartko states that the ellipse can, inter alia, be used to detect the presence of outliers (furthermore
		\citet{Bartko} proposes formal testing procedures, that shall be discussed in due course). 
		The Bland-Altman plot for the Grubbs data, complemented by Bartko's ellipse, is depicted in Figure ~\ref{GrubbsBartko1}.
		The fourth observation is shown to be outside the bounds of the ellipse, indicating that it is a potential outlier.

		The limitations of using bivariate approaches to outlier detection
		in the Bland-Altman plot can demonstrated using Bartko's ellipse.
		A covariate is added to the `F vs C' comparison that has a
		difference value equal to the inter-method bias, and an average
		value that markedly deviates from the rest of the average values
		in the comparison, i.e. 786. Table 1.8 depicts a $95\%$ confidence
		ellipse for this manipulated data set. By inspection of the
		confidence interval, a conclusion would be reached that this extra
		covariate is an outlier, in spite of the fact that this
		observation is wholly consistent with the conclusion of the
		Bland-Altman plot.

		Importantly, outlier classification must be informed by the logic of the
		data's formulation. In the Bland-Altman plot, the horizontal displacement of any
		observation is supported by two independent measurements. Any
		observation should not be considered an outlier on the basis of a
		noticeable horizontal displacement from the main cluster, as in

\section{Detection of Outliers}
Indications on how to deal with outliers in Bland Altman plots
\\
We wish to determine how outliers should be treated in a Bland
Altman Plot
\\
In their 1983 paper they merely state that the plot can be used to
'spot outliers'.
\\
In  their 1986 paper, Bland and Altman give an example of an
outlier. They state that it could be omitted in practice, but make
no further comments on the matter.
\\
In Bland and Altmans 1999 paper, we get the clearest indication of
what Bland and Altman suggest on how to react to the presence of
outliers. Their recommendation is to recalculate the limits
without them, in order to test the difference with the calculation
where outliers are retained.\\

BAExample -	The span has reduced from 77 to 59 mmHg, a noticeable but not
particularly large reduction.
\\
However, they do not recommend removing outliers. Furthermore,
they say:
\\
We usually find that this method of analysis is not too sensitive
to one or two large outlying differences.
\\
We ask if this would be so in all cases. Given that the limits of
agreement may or may not be disregarded, depending on their
perceived suitability, we examine whether it would possible that
the deletion of an outlier may lead to a calculation of limits of
agreement that are usable in all cases?
\\
Should an Outlying Observation be omitted from a data set? In
general, this is not considered prudent.
\\
Also, it may be required that the outliers are worthy of
particular attention themselves.
\\
Classifying outliers and recalculating We opted to examine this
matter in more detail. The following points have to be considered
\\how to suitably identify an outlier (in a generalized sense)
\\Would a recalculation of the limits of agreement generally
results in  a compacted range between the upper and lower limits
of agreement?

	\section{Effect of Outliers} Another argument against
	the use of model I regression is based on outliers. Outliers can
	adversely influence the fitting of a regression model. Cornbleet
	and Cochrane compare a regression model influenced by an outlier
	with a model for the same data set, with the outlier excluded from
	the data set. A demonstration of the effect of outliers was made
	in Bland Altman's 1986 paper. However they discourage the
	exclusion of outliers.

	\section{The Bland Altman Plot - Variations}
	Variations of the Bland Altman plot is the use of ratios, in the
	place of differences.
	\begin{equation}
		D_{i} = X_{i} - Y_{i}   \label{BA01}
	\end{equation}
	Altman and Bland suggest plotting the within subject differences $
	D = X_{1} - X_{2} $ on the ordinate versus the average of $x_{1}$
	and  $x_{2}$ on the abscissa.
	\section{Variations and Alternative Graphical Methods}
	In this section, we will look at some variations and enhancements of the Bland-Altman plot, as well as some alternative graphcial techniques. Strictly speaking, the Identity Plot is advised by Bland and Altman as a prior analysis to the Bland-Alman plot, and therefore is neither a variant nor an alternative approach. However it is worth mentioning, as it is a simple, powerful and elegant technique that is often overlooked in method comparison studies. The identity plot is a simple scatter-plot approach of measurements for both methods on either axis, with the line of equality (the $X=Y$ line, i.e. the 45 degree line through the origin). This plot can gives the analyst a cursory examination of how well the measurement methods agree. In the case of good agreement, the covariates of the plot accord closely with the line of equality.
	
	
	
	\section{Variations of the Bland-Altman Plot} Referring to the
	assumption that bias and variability are constant across the range
	of measurements, \citet{BA99} address the case where there is an
	increase in variability as the magnitude increases. They remark
	that it is possible to ignore the issue altogether, but the limits
	of agreement would wider apart than necessary when just lower
	magnitude measurements are considered. Conversely the limits would
	be too narrow should only higher magnitude measurements be used.
	To address the issue, they propose the logarithmic transformation
	of the data. The plot is then formulated as the difference of
	paired log values against their mean. Bland and Altman acknowledge
	that this is not easy to interpret, and may not be suitable in
	all cases.
	
	\citet{BA99} offers two variations of the Bland-Altman plot that
	are intended to overcome potential problems that the conventional
	plot would inappropriate for. The first variation is a plot of
	case-wise differences as percentage of averages, and is
	appropriate when there is an increase in variability of the
	differences as the magnitude increases. The second variation is a
	plot of case-wise ratios as percentage of averages. This will
	remove the need for $log$ transformation. This approach is useful
	when there is an increase in variability of the differences as the
	magnitude of the measurement increases. \citet{Eksborg} proposed
	such a ratio plot, independently of Bland and Altman.
	\citet{Dewitte} commented on the reception of this article by
	saying `Strange to say,this report has been overlooked'.
	
	
	% When selecting this option the differences will be expressed as
	% percentage of the averages. This option is useful when there is an
	% increase in variability of the differences as the magnitude of the
	% measurement increases.
	
	
	
	
	% Plot ratios When this option is selected then the ratios of the
	% measurements will be plotted instead of the differences (avoiding
	% the need for log transformation). This option as well is useful
	% when there is an increase in variability of the differences as the
	% magnitude of the measurement increases.
	
	
		\section{Variants of the Bland-Altman Plot}
		In light of some potential pitfalls associated with the conventional difference plot, a series of alternative formulations for the Bland-Altman approach have been proposed.
		
		Referring to the assumption that bias and variability are constant across the range
		of measurements, \citet{BA99} address the case where there is an increase in variability as the magnitude increases. They remark 	that it is possible to ignore the issue altogether, but the limits of agreement would be wider apart than necessary when just lower magnitude measurements are considered. Conversely the limits would be too narrow should only higher magnitude measurements be used.	To address the issue, they propose the logarithmic transformation of the data. The plot is then formulated as the difference of paired log values against their mean. Bland and Altman acknowledge that this is not easy to interpret, and may not be suitable in all cases.

	\section{Prevalence of the Bland-Altman plot}
	%---------------------------------------------%
	
	\citet*{BA86}, which further develops the Bland-Altman methodology,
	was found to be the sixth most cited paper of all time by the
	\citet{BAcite}. \cite{Dewitte} describes the rate at which
	prevalence of the Bland-Altman plot has developed in scientific
	literature. \citet{Dewitte} reviewed the use of Bland-Altman plots
	by examining all articles in the journal `Clinical Chemistry'
	between 1995 and 2001. This study concluded that use of the
	Bland-Altman plot increased over the years, from 8\% in 1995 to
	14\% in 1996, and 31-36\% in 2002.
	
	The Bland-Altman Plot has since become expected, and
	often obligatory, approach for presenting method comparison
	studies in many scientific journals \citep{hollis}. Furthermore
	\citet{BritHypSoc} recommend its use in papers pertaining to
	method comparison studies for the journal of the British
	Hypertension Society.
	

	\section{Bland Altman Plots In Literature}
	\citet{mantha} contains a study the use of Bland Altman plots of
	44 articles in several named journals over a two year period. 42
	articles used Bland Altman's limits of agreement, wit the other
	two used correlation and regression analyses. \citet{mantha}
	remarks that 3 papers, from 42 mention predefined maximum width
	for limits of agreement which would not impair medical care.
	
	The conclusion of \citet{mantha} is that there are several
	inadequacies and inconsistencies in the reporting of results ,and
	that more standardization in the use of Bland Altman plots is
	required. The authors recommend the prior determination of limits
	of agreement before the study is carried out. This contention is
	endorsed by \citet{lin}, which makes a similar recommendation for
	the sample size, noting that\emph{sample sizes required either was
		not mentioned or no rationale for its choice was given}.
	
	\begin{quote}
		In order to avoid the appearance of "data dredging", both the
		sample size and the (limits of agreement) should be specified and
		justified before the actual conduct of the trial. \citep{lin}
	\end{quote}
	
	\citet{Dewitte} remarks that the limits of agreement should be
	compared to a clinically acceptable difference in measurements.
