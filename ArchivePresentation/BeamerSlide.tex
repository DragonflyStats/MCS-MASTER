4. Exponential Distribution Lifetimes

The average lifespan of a laptop is 5 years. You may assume that
the lifespan of computers follows an exponential probability
distribution.
i. (3 marks) What is the probability that the
lifespan of the laptop will be at least 6 years? ii. (3 marks)

What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will not
exceed 4 years? iii. (3 marks) What is the probability of the
lifespan being between 5 years and 6 years?


Suppose the lifetime of a PC is exponentially distributed wiht
mean $\mu =5$

We should be told the average lifetime $\mu$.

\[
P( X \geq x_o) = e^{{-x_o \over \mu}}
\]

7. F-test

\[
H_o \;:\;\sigma^2_1  =  \sigma^2_2
\]
H_a \;:\;\sigma^2_1\;  \neq \; \sigma^2_2

\[
F_{TS}  = \frac{0.13^2}{0.10^2}  = 1.69
\]

F_{( 0.05, 24,24)} = 2.269277

Test statistic is less than the Critical Value.
    We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
    We can assume equal variances.
