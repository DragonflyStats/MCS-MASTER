Structural Equation Model provides a statistically rigourous analysis, but the approach is undermined in several ways.
LME models have greater flexibility and can be adapted to any variant of the method comparison research question, whereas 
SEM is suitable for some specific cases only. Highly complex models can be developed using SEM, but to overcome the problem of identifiability, a large quantity of data must be gathered.
Often this is beyond what is practical in the main applications of method comparison studies, namely the medical sciences. Once simplifications are applied, there is little functional difference between SEM and LMEs.
