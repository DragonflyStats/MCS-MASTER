Calculation of Influence diagnostics can be performed using non-iterative or iterative methods.


Non-iterative methods are computationally efficient, but require the rather strong assumption that all 
covariance parameters are known, and thus are not updated, with the exception of the profiled residual variance.

Iterative Influence diagnostics requiring fitting the model without the observations in question. Computation execution time is substantially longer, although this is balanced by algorithmic 
simplicity, with no assumptions beyond those used for the original model. Additionally iterative approaches facilitate several complementary analyses to be carried out 
concurrently.

The execution times for iterative procedures are longer relative to iterative procedures, measured in seconds rather than microseconds.
