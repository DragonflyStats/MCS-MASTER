\section{Structural Equation Modelling}
This is a statistical technique used for testing and estimating causal relationships using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions. This technique was proposed by \citet{Lewis} as a method of assessing the reliability of a new measurement technique. It can indicate the presence of bias. However Bland and Altman (1987) have criticized it on the basis that it offers no insights into the variability about the line of equality.
\\
In this paper, the SEM method is used to assess the linear relationship between the new method and the standard method.
\\
Structural analysis is a generalization of regression analysis.
\\
In Hopkins papers, a critique of the Bland-Altman plot he makes the following remark:
\\
\emph{What's needed for a comparison of two or more measures is a
generic approach more powerful even than regression to model the
relationship and error structure of each measure with a latent
variable representing the true value.}
\\
Hopkins also adds that he himself is collaborating in research utilising SEM and Mixed Effects modelling.This is a methodology proposed by Kelly (1985).
