\subsection{Repeated Measurements }
In cases where there are repeated measurements by each of the two
methods on the same subjects , Bland Altman suggest calculating
the mean for each method on each subject and use these pairs of
means to compare the two methods.
\\
The estimate of bias will be unaffected using this approach, but
the estimate of the standard deviation of the differences will be
too small, because of the reduction of the effect of repeated
measurement error. Bland Altman propose a correction for this.
\\
Carstensen attends to this issue also, adding that another
approach would be to treat each repeated measurement separately.

In this model , the variances of the random effects must depend on
$m$, since the different methods do not necessarily measure on the
same scale, and different methods naturally must be assumed to
have different variances. \citet{BXC2004} attends to the issue of
comparative variances.
